 <h1>DRAFT Requirements for "Silver" Accessibility Guidelines</h1>
 <p>This is a development of an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15F4KuNXYK5q2rOgb4ktHiJQMQpAEL9EetARpMU3vD_A/edit#">initial
draft on google docs</a>. This is work in progress, and comments are
welcome as <a href="https://github.com/w3c/silver/issues">Github Issues</a> or by <a href="mailto:public-silver@w3.org?subject=[Comment%20Silver%20Requirements]">email</a>. This version includes comments received by 29 May 2018 and discussion from the Silver Task Force and Commuity Group as of 29 May 2018. See the changelog for specific changes. </p>

 <h2>Introduction</h2>
 <p>People with disabilities can face problems using online content and
applications. Disabilities can be permanent, temporary, or situational. Most of the requirements in Silver prioritize the needs of permanent disabilities, but the requirements can also apply to temporary or situational disabilities. </p>
 <p>We need guidelines to:</p>
 <ul>
<li> identify these barriers encountered by people with disabilities.</li>
<li>explain how to solve the problems they pose.</li>
</ul>
 <h2>Background: Problem Statements Around Current Guidelines</h2>
 <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/silver/wiki/Problem_Statements">Problem
   Statements</a> describe areas that came up in research for Silver in
   2017-2018 that we need to focus on and address in the new guidelines, to
   provide some background for how we developed these requirements.</p>

<h2>Design Principles</h2>
 <p>Accessibility guidelines should:</p>
 <ol>
<li> Support the needs of the widest possible range of people with disabilities.</li>
<li>Support measuring changes in the level of conformance.</li>
<li> Be flexible enough to support the needs of people with disabilities
using emerging technologies. </li>
<li> Be usable and accessible.</li>
<li>Be written in plain language, as easy as possible to understand.</li>
 </ol>
 <p>The development process for the guidelines should</p>
 <ol>
<li> include people with disabilities,</li>
<li>have global participation and feedback. </li>
<li> Be about and for people â€“ technology is important but secondary. </li>
<li> Strive to be data informed and evidence based. </li>
<li> Include the principles and intent of previous guidelines</li>
 </ol>
 <h2>Requirements</h2>
 <p>Previous W3C Accessibility Guidelines described how to make web
pages accessible to people with disabilities. Those guidelines provided a flexible framework that has kept the guidelines relevant for as many as 10 years, but changing technology and needs of people with disabilities has shown areas where they could be improved. The requirements are drawn from the research performed by Silver to improve the guidelines, and the suggestions from the Silver Design Sprint. These requirements are high level, and will be expanded and refined as Silver members move through the prototyping process. </p>
 <p>These requirements will be refined in Q3 of 2018 at the end of the prototyping process and in 2019 after public input from the First Public Working Draft. </p>
 <ol>
<li> Provide more information than a simple pass/fail statement. For
example, it may describe "minimal" and "better" methods of conforming to
a requirement. </li>
<li> Create a structure for guidelines that can better meet the needs of
people with disabilities in unanticipated technologies and interactions. The structure is flexible and forgiving of unanticipated needs. </li>
<li> Make the guidelines available in different accessible and usable
ways. </li>
 </ol>
<h2>Changelog</h2>
 <p>Other changes of 30 May 2018:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>Add short sentences on the timeline for updating the Requirements document based on meeting of Cooper, Lauriat and Spellman of 23 March 2018. </li>
 </ul>
<p>From the Silver meeting of 29 May 2018:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>Reorder the sections so that the background is first, folowed by Design Principles, then Requirements</li>
   <li>Clarify the broader definition of "disabilities" based on input from public comments and group discussion. The definition sentence in the Introduction paragraph is a proposal for group discussion. </li>
</ul>
<p>From the Silver meeting of 25 May 2018: </p>
 <ul>
   <li>Insert missing word "people" from Design Principle #1    
   <li>Change &quot;future&quot; to &quot;unanticipated&quot; in Requirements #2 and add subsequent sentence. 
 <li>Change the Requirements Intro paragraph to remove the specific sentence on conformance and pass/fail tests and give greater context on the source of the Requirements. </ul>
