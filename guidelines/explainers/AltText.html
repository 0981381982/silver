Code for the tabbed interface for this W3C Silver Prototype was lovingly ripped from https://inclusive-components.design/tabbed-interfaces/ with the example code taken from https://codepen.io/heydon/pen/veeaEa .

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The purpose of this guideline is to ensure that all non-text content is also available in text. "Text" refers to electronic text, not an image of text. Electronic text has the unique advantage that it is presentation neutral. (From <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/text-alternatives#intent">"Intent" of "Understanding Guideline 1.1: Text Alternatives"</a>
</p>
<h3>Why</h3>
<p>That is, it can be rendered visually, auditorily, tactilely, or by any combination. As a result, information rendered in electronic text can be presented in whatever form best meets the needs of the user. It can also be easily enlarged, spoken aloud so that it is easier for people with reading disabilities to understand, or rendered in whatever tactile form best meets the needs of a user. (From <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/text-alternatives#intent">"Intent" of "Understanding Guideline 1.1: Text Alternatives"</a></p>
<h3>Who it helps</h3>
<ul>
<li>(From <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-content.html#benefits">"Benefits" of Understanding Success Criterion 1.1.1: Non-text Content</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>This Success Criterion helps people who have difficulty perceiving visual content. Assistive technology can read text aloud, present it visually, or convert it to braille.</li>
<li>Text alternatives may help some people who have difficulty understanding the meaning of photographs, drawings, and other images (e.g., line drawings, graphic designs, paintings, three-dimensional representations), graphs, charts, animations, etc.</li>
<li>People who are deaf, are hard of hearing, or who are having trouble understanding audio information for any reason can read the text presentation. Research is ongoing regarding automatic translation of text into sign language.</li>
<li>People who are deaf-blind can read the text in braille.</li>
<li>Additionally, text alternatives support the ability to search for non-text content and to repurpose content in a variety of ways.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(From <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/#why-is-this-important">"Why is this important?” in “Images Concepts” of “WAI Tutorials”</a>  
<ul>
<li>People using screen readers: The text alternative can be read aloud or rendered as Braille</li>
<li>People using speech input software: Users can put the focus onto a button or linked image with a single voice command</li>
<li>People browsing speech-enabled websites: The text alternative can be read aloud</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The followings are not about users with disabilities:
<ul>
<li>Mobile web users: Images can be turned off, especially for data-roaming</li>
<li>Search engine optimization: Images become indexable by search engines</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
