			<p>W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0 provides a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible to users with disabilities. Following these guidelines will address many of the needs of users with blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, learning disabilities and cognitive limitations, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these. These guidelines address accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, mobile devices, wearable devices, and other Web of Things devices. They address various types of web content including static content, interactive content, visual and auditory media, and virtual and augmented reality. The guidelines also address related web tools such as user agents (browsers and assistive technologies), content management systems, authoring tools, and testing tools.</p>
			<p>Each <a href="#guidelines">guideline</a> in this standard provides information on accessibility practices that address documented <a>user needs</a> of people with disabilities. Guidelines are supported by multiple <a href="#outcomes">outcomes</a> to measure if the need has been met.  Guidelines are also supported by technology-specific <a href="#methods">methods</a> to meet each outcome. This specification is expected to be updated regularly to keep pace with technology change, both by updating or adding methods and by adding guidelines to address new needs as technologies evolve. For entities that make formal claims of <a>conformance</a> to these guidelines, several grades of conformance are available to address the diverse nature of digital content and the type of testing that is performed.</p>
			<p>W3C Accessibility Guidelines 3.0 is a successor to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2</a> [[WCAG22]] and previous versions. They also incorporate content from and partially extend <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/">User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [[UAAG20]] and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [[ATAG20]]. 
			Content that conforms to all WCAG 2.2 A and AA success criteria is expected to substantially conform to a conformance level of WCAG 3.0, though these guidelines have many differences from WCAG 2.x. WCAG 3.0 does not supersede WCAG 2.2 and previous versions; rather, it is an alternative and more modern set of guidelines. Once these guidelines become a W3C Recommendation, the W3C will advise developers, content creators and policy makers to use WCAG 3.0 in order to maximize future applicability of accessibility efforts.  However, content that conforms to earlier versions of
				WCAG continue to conform to those versions.</p>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<aside class="summary">
				<p>The W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0 specify ways to make Web content accessible to users with disabilities. These guidelines will replace the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2. </p>
				<p><strong>What’s new in WCAG 3.0?</strong></p>
				<p>WCAG 3.0 speaks to a wider range of people with disabilities. It covers the design of Web content and applications across a variety of platforms. It presents new methods and tests for making content accessible using existing and more recent technologies.</p>
				<p>The WCAG 3.0 guidelines form an up-to-date standard for addressing the diverse needs of people with disabilities. The Silver Task Force and its research partners integrated recent ideas about what works. Importantly, we changed our model for conforming to the standard. </p>
				<p>Some organizations may wish to use the previous guidelines. Others may wish to migrate to the new standard.</p>
				<p><strong>Who benefits from the guidelines?</strong></p>
				<p>While the guidelines focus on preventing barriers for people with disabilities, following the guidelines will improve the experience of <em>all</em> who use the content, not only people with disabilities.</p>
				<p><strong>What did the Silver Task Force focus on?</strong></p>
				<p>Our aim for these updated guidelines was to make them usable for a broader audience. To that end, most of the changes focused on</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Improving usability of the guidelines – especially for people starting out in accessible design</li>
					<li>Supporting a wider range of accessibility needs – such as cognitive disabilities, whose needs aren’t readily tested by true/false success criteria</li>
					<li>Keeping the guidelines current – by improving ways of maintaining them</li>
					<li>Considering new technological issues – such as publishing requirements and emerging technologies</li>
					<li>Designing the standard to be easy to update and maintain – especially as technologies evolve</li>
					<li>Specifying clear guidance – by using plain language, structure, and design</li>
					<li>Offering advice about web technologies and how they need to work – particularly with authoring tools, user agents, and assistive technologies</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>How did the focus evolve?</strong></p>
				<p>The Silver Task Force identified a set of requirements for improving on earlier guidelines. Our research led us to make these a priority:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Multiple ways to measure – to provide more ways to gauge success</li>
					<li>Flexible maintenance and extensibility – so guidelines can be updated quickly</li>
					<li>Multiple ways to display – to enable the guidelines to be customized</li>
					<li>Technology neutrality – so guidance applies across platforms and technologies</li>
					<li>Readability/Usability – to ensure the guidelines are usable and understandable</li>
					<li>Regulatory environment – to support adopting the guidelines into policy and law</li>
					<li>Motivation – by using a scoring system that nudges organizations to take accessibility to the next level</li>
					<li>Scope – to offer guidance for digital assets and technology of varying size and complexity</li>
				</ul>
				<p>These requirements shaped our model for conforming to the standard. </p>
			</aside>
			<p>This specification creates a new framework and guidelines to make web content and applications accessible to people with disabilities. W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0 supports a wide set of user needs, uses new approaches to testing, and allows frequent maintenance of guidelines to keep pace with accelerating technology change. WCAG 3.x continues this evolution by focusing on users’ functional needs. These are then supported by technology-specific methods to meet that need. </p>
			<p>Following these guidelines will make content more accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities. This includes accommodations for blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement, speech disabilities, sensory disorders, learning disabilities, cognitive disabilities and combinations of these. Following these guidelines will also often make content more usable to users in general as well as accessible to individuals with disabilities.</p>
			<p>WCAG 3.0 is a successor to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2</a> [[WCAG22]] and previous versions. They also incorporate content from and partially extend <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/"> User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [[UAAG20]] and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/"> Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [[ATAG20]]. These earlier versions provided a flexible framework that kept them relevant for over 10 years. However, changing technology and changing needs of people with disabilities has led to the need for a new framework to address content accessibility more comprehensively and flexibly. </p>
			<p>There are many differences between WCAG 2.x and WCAG 3.x but content that conforms to WCAG 2.2 A &amp; AA is expected to substantially conform to the minimum conformance level of this new standard. Since the new standard will use a different conformance model, the Working Group expects that some organizations may wish to continue using WCAG 2.x, while others may wish to migrate to the new standard. For those that wish to migrate to the new standard, the Working Group will provide transition support materials, which may use mapping and / or other approaches to facilitate migration.</p>
			<section>
			<h3>Scope of WCAG 3.0</h3>
				<p>The Silver Community Group and their research partners conducted a year of research which included a literature review as well as interviews, surveys, and self-reporting with people with disabilities, content developers, quality assurance professionals, tool developers, designers and policy makers.</p>
				<p>The results are available in <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1POs7orJ4ALB0bq5_vyo4v8RxDcr-5ctwD1noVgpXuJc/edit#slide=id.gc6f73a04f_0_0">The Research Summary Slide Deck</a>. One recurring theme was the popularity and quality of the guidance in WCAG 2.0. Most of the opportunities identified in the research were changes in the structure and presentation of accessibility guidance to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>improve usability — especially for beginners;</li>
					<li>support disability needs that cannot be tested by true/false success criteria; and</li>
					<li>improve maintenance to keep the guidelines more current.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The goal of WCAG 3.0 is to provide information that can be used to improve the accessibility of products on a variety of platforms. WCAG 3.0 uses a framework that allows it to address more disability needs than WCAG 2.X, as well as address publishing requirements and emerging technologies on the web such as web XR (augmented, virtual and mixed reality) and voice input. It will also provide non-<a>normative</a> information about the ways web technologies need to work with authoring tools, user agents, and assistive technologies. The WCAG 3.0 framework is designed to support better coverage across disabilities and be easier to maintain, so that the new framework will be more durable over time as technologies evolve.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Relationship to other W3C guidelines</h3>
				<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</a> [[WCAG20]] was designed to be technology neutral, and has stayed relevant for over 10 years. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0</a> [[ATAG20]] provide guidance for various types of software that assist people in writing accessible content. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/">User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) 2.0</a> [[UAAG20]] offers useful guidance to user agent developers and has been implemented on an individual success criterion basis. </p>
				<p>These guidelines have normative guidance for content and helpful implementation advice for authoring tools, user agents and assistive technologies.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>WCAG 3.0 incorporates but may not be all encompassing of WCAG, ATAG, and UAAG.</li>
					<li>WCAG 3.0 is not backward compatible with WCAG 2.0, ATAG 2.0, and UAAG 2.0.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>For more details about differences from previous guidelines, see <a href="#differences-from-wcag-2">Appendix: Differences From WCAG 2</a>.</p>

				<h3>Key requirements</h3>
				<p>Research and design work performed by the Silver Task Force identified key requirements needed to improve upon the existing WCAG 2.x structure. These requirements shaped the conformance proposal that follows and should be taken into account when evaluating and updating this proposal.</p>
				<p>The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/silver/requirements/">Requirements for Silver</a> documents the following requirements which are met by this document:</p>

			<h2>Structure of these guidelines</h2>
			<aside class="summary">
				<p>The WCAG 3.0 guidelines evolved by focusing on the diverse needs of people with disabilities. We studied ways the designed digital context may create barriers for people. </p>
				<p>Our research led to cataloging users’ functional needs. That is, what in the designed context could be changed to reduce barriers and promote ease of use?  </p>
				<p>The guidelines highlight users’ functional needs, such as the need for contrast. We elaborate on the advice by specifying practices that reduce barriers. The results of using these practices can be tested. We offer a variety of tests to rate how well user needs have actually been met. </p>
				<p><strong>How is the advice organized?</strong></p>
				<p>To help make the advice usable, we structured it in layers:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Functional categories</strong>: high level groupings of disabilities to aid in testing and remediating technology. Similar to functional performance criteria in Section 508 and functional performance statements in EN 301 549.  </li>
					<li><strong>Guidelines</strong>: related solutions to functional needs that cross technologies and functional categories</li>
					<li><strong>How-to information:</strong>: plain language advice by guideline on adapting content to meet users’ functional needs including information on getting started and how guidelines apply across technologies.</li>
					<li><strong>Outcomes</strong>: the desired result (or outcome) of practices that reduce barriers and support ease of use in the designed context</li>
					<li><strong>Methods</strong>: detailed techniques and tests for rating how well a outcome for a technology has been met</li>
					<li><b>Tags</b>: searchable concepts to improve findability and usability</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Not all of these layers are directly in this document. Some are pieces linked from here.</p>

				<figcaption>Structure of WCAG 3 Guidance</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>WCAG 3 has several layers and types of content with interrelationships. <a href="#guidelines-structure-diagram">Figure 1</a> shows the layers.  <span id="guidelines-structure-description">Functional Needs are grouped in Functional Categories. These combine with Guideline topics to inform the Outcomes. How To documents are information about the Guidelines. Methods are specific to technology and include sections of description, examples, tests, and scoring. The scoring section information is used to calculate the overall score for the optional conformance claim. The overall score determines the conformance level of bronze, silver or gold.  </span></p>
			<section>
				<h3>Functional categories and functional needs</h3>
				<p>@@JS: The development of WCAG 3 guidelines start with <a>functional needs</a>. A functional need is a statement that describes a specific gap in one’s ability, or a specific mismatch between ability and the designed environment or context. Functional categories group the diverse needs of users with disabilities. Within each functional category, functional needs are applied to specific topics (for example: contrast, forms, readability, and more)  to identify the barriers experienced by people with disabilities. The barriers in these topics inform the <a href="#outcomes">Outcomes</a>, which state the conditions to test whether the Functional Needs have been met. Functional Needs are documented in the supplementary material accompanying the Guidelines in the How-To.  </p>
				<p>@@RB: The highest level of organization, Functional Categories of disabilities, group the diverse needs of users with disabilities. Within each Functional Category, <a>Functional Needs</a> are applied to specific topics (for example: contrast, forms, readability, and more)  to identify the barriers experienced by people with disabilities. The barriers in these topics inform the <a href="#outcomes">Outcomes</a>, which state the conditions to test whether the Functional Needs have been met.  </p>
				<p>Functional categories are used when reporting test results to reduce bias across different types of disabilities.</p>
				<p class="example">Example: Vision and Visual</p>
				<p class="ednote">The work of cataloging functional needs is still in process and will continue after the First Public Working Draft.  Those interested can see more information in this draft Google document <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eJkgXqbh7dx3uD6XAy8XAANmwfbbVZ5GKb_gbsUdkVs/">Functional Needs - Expanded</a></p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Guidelines</h3>
				<p>Guidelines provide a high-level, plain-language version of the content for  managers, policy makers, beginners to accessibility and other individuals who need to understand the concepts but not dive into the technical details. They provide an easy-to-understand way of organizing and presenting the outcomes so that non-experts can learn about and understand the concepts. Guidelines include a unique, descriptive name along with high level plain language summaries that address Functional Needs on specific topics, such as contrast, forms, readability, and more. Guidelines group related Outcomes and are technology-independent.</p>				
				<blockquote>Example: Use headings, sections, and sub-headings to organize your text. </blockquote>			
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>How-to information</h3>
				<p>The <a>How-To</a> content provides explanatory material for each guideline that applies across technologies. This guidance explains how to apply the concepts presented in the guidelines for non-technical readers. This plain language resource includes information on getting started, who the guideline helps and how, as well information for project managers, designers and developers.  </p>
				<p class="example">Example: Provides semantic structure that conveys a sense of hierarchy </p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Outcomes</h3>
				<p>Outcomes are the results of practices that reduce or eliminate barriers that people with disabilities experience. Outcomes form the basis of a flexible and expansive architecture for accessibility guidelines that relates closely to the needs of people with disabilities. Specific tests can be used to assess the accessibility of common technologies and the overall Outcome can be used to assess proprietary and new technologies. </p>
				<p>Outcomes are <a>normative</a>. They are located in the normative section of specific guidelines. </p>
				<p>Outcomes place less emphasis on Web technologies so can be used to evaluate different technologies including emerging and proprietary technology. Outcomes are designed for developers, testers, and other technical experts.</p>
				<p class="example">Example: Headings (HTML &amp; ARIA)</p>
				<p class="example">Example: Provides semantic structure that conveys a sense of hierarchy </p>
			</section> 
			<section>
				<h3>Methods</h3>
				<p>Each Outcome has one or more <a href="#methods">Methods</a>. Methods are technology specific (ex: HTML) or technology agnostic (All) depending on the outcome. When technology specific methods are provided, the outcomes also includes
				one or more methods for use with technology that is emerging, proprietary or does not yet have a method written. </p>
				<p>The methods include detailed information on techniques to meet the outcome as well as tests and scoring information. Methods are designed for developers, testers, and other technical experts.</p>
				<blockquote>Example: Headings (HTML and ARIA)</blockquote>

				<p>The method descriptions provide technology-specific approaches to follow methods. They include code samples and working examples, and provide information about testing and scoring.</p>
				<p class="note">While WCAG 3 Techniques have some similarity with WCAG 2 Techniques, they are not the same and are not interchangable.</p>
				<div class="example"><p>Example: There are two ways to approach providing structure in HTML:</p> 
					<ul><li>Native HTML semantic tags, such as h3 and main</li>
						<li>ARIA attributes for HTML tags</li> 
						<li>Use one or the other.  Don’t use both in the same tag or element. </li></ul>
				</div>
				<p>Tests provide ways to check that methods and techniques have been followed. Tests include step-by-step instructions on evaluating the method based on the technology being used. </p>
				<p>Scoring is designed to be more flexible than in WCAG 2.x in order to allow more user needs of people with disabilities to be included in the Guidelines.  Tests can include true /false evaluation or various types of rating scales as appropriate for the outcome and technology.  Tests may vary by technology as needed.</p>  				
				<p>Each Method includes information on how to score individual instances of the test, and how to score the Outcome in an optional <a href="#conformance-claims">Conformance Claim</a>. </p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h3>Tags</h3>
				<p>Tags will be added to WCAG 3.0 to improve findability and usability. For example, tags will be provided for functional categories, technologies, WCAG 2 principles and WCAG 2 success criteria, and others still under discussion. </p>
				<p class="ednote">Tagging is still in process and will continue after the First Public Working Draft.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Conformance Levels</h3>
				<p>WCAG 3 has an optional scoring system that can better inform organizations on the quality of their accessibility effort. The optional conformance levels provide a way for organizations to report their conformance in simple manner. The bronze level is based on the overall score. Silver and gold levels require an overall score that passes the bronze level plus additional improved usability for people with disabilties.  </p>
				<p class="ednote">This first draft focuses on bronze level. Future drafts will have more information on silver and gold levels.  We expect that bronze will be similar to WCAG 2 AA, while silver and gold will include more usability-type testing. This is still under development. WCAG 2.x AAA success criteria are generally included in WCAG 3.  The design of the scoring model awards more points for implementing the outcomes that come from WCAG 2.x AAA. </p>

			<h2>Normative requirements</h2>
			<aside class="summary">
				<p>WCAG 3.0 details the needs of people with disabilities and suggests how to test for what works. You may to want to make formal claims about how well the results of your testing conform to the standard set out by the guidelines. </p>
				<p>If you do, notice there are two types of content signaled in this document:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Normative</strong>. Refers to requirements that impact the accessibility of content. Normative requirements specify what conforming to the standard means.</li>
					<li><strong>Non-normative</strong>. Refers to parts of this document that do not impact conforming to the standard. This advisory content is never required. Non-normative content includes overviews, appendices, diagrams, and examples. It is also called “Informative”. </li>
				</ul>
			</aside>
			<p>The main content of WCAG 3.0 is <a>normative</a> and defines requirements that impact conformance claims. Introductory material, appendices, sections marked as "non-normative", diagrams, examples, and notes are <a>informative</a> (non-normative). Non-normative material provides advisory information to help interpret the guidelines but does not create requirements that impact a conformance claim.</p>

			<p class="ednote">The working group is looking for feedback whether the just the functional outcomes should be normative or whether both the guidelines and the functional outcomes should be normative.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Guidelines</h2>
			<p>The individuals and organizations that use WCAG vary widely and include Web designers and developers, policy makers, purchasing agents, teachers, and students. In order to meet the varying needs of this audience, several layers of guidance are provided including functional categories of disabilities, general guidelines, outcomes that can be tested, a rich collection of methods, and documented common failures with examples, resource links, and code.</p>

			<p class="ednote">The process of migrating information from WCAG 2.x to WCAG 3.0 has just begun. This document presents initial examples of how the structure works. The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/silver/guidelines/explainers/template.html">template for the new content</a> presents the skeleton of the architecture and may help . We welcome comments on this. </p>
			<p class="ednote">These are early drafts of guidelines. They are used to illustrate what WCAG 3.0 could look like and to test the process of writing content. These guideline drafts should not be considered as final content of WCAG 3.0. They are there to show how the structure would work. As this draft matures, numbering of individual guidelines will be removed to improve overall usability of the guidelines in response to public requests. </p>
			<p>As more content is developed, this section will be a list of guidelines with a unique short name, and the text of the requirement written in plain language. To see the overall plan for migrating content from WCAG 2.1 to WCAG 3.0, see the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aCRXrtmnSSTso-6S_IO9GQ3AKTB4FYt9k92eT_1PWX4/edit">WCAG to Silver Outline Map</a>.</p>

				<h3>Visual contrast of text</h3>
				<div class="ednote">
					<p>Visual Contrast is a migration from WCAG 2.1 with significant updates:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>New calculations of contrast based on more modern research on color perception.</li>
						<li>Merging the 1.4.3 AA and 1.4.6 AAA levels into one guideline.</li>
						<li>New test of text contrast.</li>
						<li>At this time, it only includes textual visual contrast.</li>
					</ul>
				<p>We propose changing the name of “Color Contrast” to “Visual Contrast” as a signal of a paradigm change from one about color to one about “perception of light intensity”. The reason for this change is that the understanding of contrast has matured and the available research and body of knowledge has made breakthroughs in advancing the understanding of “visual contrast”.</p>
				<p>The proposed new guidance more accurately models current research in human visual perception of contrast and light intensity. The goal is to improve understanding of the functional needs of all users, and more effectively match the needs of those who face barriers accessing content. This new perception-based model is more context dependent than a strict light ratio measurement; results can, for example, vary with size of text and the darkness of the colors or background.</p>
				<p>This model is more responsive to user needs and allows designers more choice in visual presentation. It does this by including multi-factor assessment tests which integrate contrast with interrelated elements of visual readability, such as font features. It includes tests to determine an upper limit of contrast, where elevated contrast may impact usability.</p>

			<h2>Evaluation</h2>
			<aside class="summary">
				<p>Testing has always been important in designing for accessibility. <!-- Web content should be tested by people who understand how people with different types of disabilities use the technology being tested. --></p>

				<p>WCAG 3.0 includes two types of tests:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Atomic tests</strong>: Tests applied to an object or set of objects within an interface. Similar to the tests for A, AA, and AAA Success Criteria in WCAG 2.x. (These tests are used to reach a Bronze rating.)</li>
					<li><strong>Holistic tests</strong>: User-centered design methods, assistive technology testing, user and expert usability testing. (These tests are used to reach a Silver or Gold rating.)</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="ednote">We are looking for more appriate terms to distinguish between these two types of tests and welcome sugggestions</p> 
				<p>Some content will meet outcomes using atomic tests. Even so, that content may not be usable by the range of people with disabilities. We address this gap with holistic tests.</p>
				<p><strong>How are tests scored?</strong></p>
				<p>An important goal of WCAG 3.0 was to go beyond binary true/false scoring methods. We include testing options for new guidance, such as rubrics and scales. </p>
				<p>Each outcome has methods related to different technologies. Methods contain tests and techniques for meeting outcomes.</p>
				<p>Tests are applied at the view level and totaled across views. We describe ways that results can be scored by the functional categories they support. Views are a general way of describing digital content such as web pages, pdf documents, ebook pages, mobile screens, the wrap around of virtual reality, and more. </p>
			</aside>
			<p class="ednote">We continue to test this approach and others for validity, reliability, sensitivity, and adequacy, and complexity.  Alternatives that we are exploring are noted as separate editor’s notes where applicable. We welcome suggestions on ways to improve the scoring to better meet these criteria.</p>
			
			<section>
				<h3>Testing</h3>
				
				<p>WCAG 3.0 tests and scores <a href="#outcomes">outcomes</a>. Outcomes are written as testable criteria that allow testers to objectively determine if the content they are evaluating satisfies the criteria. </p> 
				<p>Testing Outcomes uses both <a>views</a> and <a>processes</a> to define what is being tested.  Views include all content visually and programmatically available without a substantive change. Processes are a sequence of steps that need to be completed in order to accomplish an activity/task from end-to-end. When testing processes, the content used to complete the process as well as all of the associated views need to be included in the test. </p>

				<section>
				<h4>Types of tests</h4>
								
				<p>WCAG 3.0 includes two types of tests: <a href="#atomic-tests">atomic tests</a> and <a href="#holistic-tests">holistic tests</a>. Testing the outcomes using the atomic tests might involve a combination of <a>automated evaluation</a>, <a>semi-automated evaluation</a>,  and <a>human evaluation</a>. <!--The content should be tested by those who understand how people with different types of disabilities use the technology being tested.--></p>
					<p>Although content may satisfy all Outcomes using the atomic tests, the content may not always be usable by people with a wide variety of disabilities. The holistic tests address this gap by evaluating more of the user experience than atomic testing. </p>
					<section>
						<h5>Atomic tests</h5>
						<p>Atomic tests evaluate content, often at an <a>object</a> level, for accessibility. Atomic tests include the existing tests that support A, AA, and AAA <a>Success Criteria</a> in WCAG 2.x. They also include tests that may require additional context or expertise beyond tests that fit within the WCAG 2.x structure.  In WCAG 3.0, atomic tests are used to test both processes and views.  Test results are then aggregated across the selected views. Critical failures within selected processes are also totaled. Successful results of the atomic tests are used to reach a <a href="#bronze">Bronze</a> rating.</p>
						<p>Atomic tests may be <a>automated</a> or <a>manual</a>. Automated testing can be completed without human assistance. These tests allow for a larger scope to be tested but <a>automated evaluation</a> alone can not determine accessibility. Over time, the number of accessibility tests that can be automated is increasing, but manual testing is still required to evaluate most methods at this time.</p> 
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>Holistic Tests</h5>
						<p>Holistic tests include assistive technology testing, user-centered design methods, and both user and expert usability testing.  Holistic testing applies to the entire declared scope and often uses the declared processes to guide the tests selected.  Successful results of holistic tests are used to reach a <a href="#silver">Silver</a> or <a href="#gold">Gold</a> rating.</p>
					</section>

				</section>
				<section>
				<h4>Technology specific testing</h4>				
				<p>Each outcome includes <a href="#methods">methods</a> associated with different technologies. Each method contains <a>tests</a> and <a>techniques</a> for satisfying the outcome.  The outcome is written so that testers can test the accessibility of new and emerging technologies that do not have related methods based solely on the outcome. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Critical failures</h4>
					
					<p>Evaluating <a>processes</a> requires counting <a>critical failures</a> that occur within the process and associated <a>views</a>. Critical failures are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Errors located anywhere within the view that stop a user from being able to use that view (examples: flashing, keyboard trap, audio with no pause);</li>
						<li>Errors that when located within a <a>process</a> stop a user from completing a process (example: submit button not in tab order); and</li>
						<li>Errors that when aggregated within a view or across a process stop a user from using the view or completing the process (example: a large amount of confusing, ambiguous language).</li>
					</ul>				
					<p><a href="#outcomes">Outcomes</a> specify the related critical failures that can occur and how to identify them. Any critical failures will result in the lowest score for the functional outcome.</p>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Evaluation scope</h3>
				<p class="ednote">@@@ Note from Peter and Janina</p>
				<p>When evaluating the accessibility of content, WCAG 3.0 requires the outcomes apply to a specific scope. While the scope can be an all content within a site or technology, it is usually one or more sub-sets of the whole. Reasons for this include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Large amounts of content are impractical to evaluate comprehensively using anything beyond <a>automated evaluation</a> of <a href="#atomic-tests">atomic tests</a>;</li>
					<li>In many cases, content changes frequently, causing evaluation to be accurate only for a specific moment in time;</li>
					<li>Some content is more important to the majority of users than other content; and</li>
					<li>Content that mostly meets the requirements but has problems can interfere with the user's ability to complete a process begun elsewhere.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>WCAG 3.0 therefore defines two inter-related ways to scope content: <a href="#views">views</a> and <a href="#processes">processes</a>. Evaluation is done on one or more complete views or processes, and conformance is determined on the basis of one or more complete views or processes. This is defined further in <a href="#defining-conformance-scope">Defining Conformance Scope</a>.</p>

				<section>
					<h4>Views</h4>
					<p>A view is a single interaction with web content. Conceptually, it corresponds to the definition of a "web page" as used in WCAG 2.x, but is not restricted to content meeting that definition. Each change of content as understood by the user comprises a new view.</p>
					<p class="ednote">To flesh out more.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Processes</h4>
					<p>A process is a complete activity the user performs using the web content. Example tasks include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Logging into a site and being recognized as an authenticated user;</li>
						<li>Ordering an item, in which case the process includes the entire set of tasks from searching for the item, adding it to the shopping cart, paying for it, and receiving confirmation;</li>
						<li>Submitting tax information, from start to end of the process;</li>
						<li>Interacting with other users in a virtual reality environment.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>A process is comprised of one or more <a href="#views">views</a>.</p>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Scoring</h3>
				<p class="ednote">One the goals of WCAG 3.0 is to expand scoring tests of methods beyond a binary true/false choice at the page level. We have included tests within the sample outcomes that demonstrate alternatives such as <a>rubrics</a> and <a>scales</a>. We are also exploring integrating these options into <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/">Accessibility Conformance Testing</a> format. We will include example tests in a future draft. Our intent is to include detailed <a href="https://w3c.github.io/silver/requirements/#multiple-ways-to-measure">tests for methods</a> to support each outcome within the WCAG 3.0 framework.</p>
				<p>Each <a href="#outcomes"> outcome</a> has <a href="#methods">methods</a> associated with different technologies. Each method contains <a>tests</a> and <a>techniques</a> for meeting that outcome. Testers can test the accessibility of new and emerging technologies that do not have related methods based on the outcome.</p>

				<section>
				<h4>Scoring atomic tests</h4>
				<p>In most cases, testing individual <a>objects</a> will result in binary, pass / fail outcome for each element. This leads to either a pass / fail or a percentage rating depending on the test. A rating scale may be provided for some tests to allow the tester to assign a quality judgement of an element or block of content. Each of these results can be assigned a percentage and the percentages informs the overall score of a outcome.</p>
					<p>Test results for views:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Tests that results in a pass or fail condition will be assigned a 100% or 0%;</li>
						<li>Tests at the element level that can be consistently counted will be assigned a percentage (number passed / total number of instances);</li>
						<li>Tests that apply to content without clear boundaries will be scored using a <a>rating scale</a>. The rating scales may vary based on the test and may be presented as numeric scale, an <a>adjectival rating </a> or a <a>rubric</a>. Each of these can be converted into a percentage to make it easier to compare across tests.</li>
					</ul>
				<p>In addition, <a>critical failures</a> within selected processes will be identified and totaled. Any critical failures will result in score of very poor (0). </p>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h4>Scoring outcomes</h4>
				<p>The results from the atomic tests are aggregated across views and used along with the number of critical failures to assign an <a>adjectival</a> rating to the Outcome. Testers will then use the guidance provided in the outcome along with reasonable judgement of the context that the errors occur in to assign an accessibility score of the Outcome.</p>
					<div class="example">
						<p>Potential thresholds for adjectival ratings of test results:</p>
					<dl>
					<dt>Very Poor (0)</dt>
					<dd>Any critical failures or less than 50% of related tests pass</dd>
					<dt>Poor (1)</dt>
					<dd>No critical failures, <abbr title="approximately">approx.</abbr> 50% to 79% of related tests pass</dd>
					<dt>Fair (2)</dt>
						<dd>No critical failures, approx. 80% to 89% of related tests pass</dd>
					<dt>Good  (3)</dt>
						<dd>No critical failures, approx. 90% to 98% of related tests pass</dd>
					<dt>Excellent (4)</dt>
						<dd>No critical failures, approx. 99% to 100% of related tests pass</dd>
				</dl>
						<p class="note">The thresholds are different for different outcomes.</p>
				<p class="ednote">These cutoff points are still being tested and adjusted. These are included as examples to gather feedback on this scoring approach. </p>
					</div>
				</section>
				
				<section>
				<h4>Overall scores</h4>
				<p>After all Outcomes have been scored, the ratings are averaged for a total score and a score by the <a href="#functional-categories">functional category(ies)</a> they support. Conformance at the <a href="#bronze">Bronze</a> level requires no critical failures and at least 3.5 total score and at least a 3.5 score within each functional category. </p>
				
				<p class="ednote">This approach, which allows the tester some flexibility in assigning scores, has the advantage of simplicity and allowing a tester to take the context into account beyond the simple percentages. The second option we are exploring is to carry percentages from tests through to a final score. In this case a Bronze rating would require a total score of at least 90% and at least 90% within each functional need category. This number would likely shift as we continue testing.  We invite comment on these options as well as suggestions for an alternative solution. </p>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h4>Scoring holistic tests</h4>			
				<p>The points from <a href="#holistic-tests">holistic tests</a> do not affect the scores of <a href="#atomic-tests">atomic tests</a>. Rather a minimum number of holistic tests will need to be met in order to reach a <a href="#silver">Silver</a> rating and additional holistic tests will be needed to reach a <a href="#gold">Gold</a> rating. Getting a Silver or Gold rating requires a Bronze rating.</p>  
				<p class="ednote">We continue to work on the scoring of holistic tests and will provide more details in a future iteration of this document. </p>

While there is a lot of overlap between WCAG 2.x and WCAG 3.0, WCAG 3 includes additional tests and different scoring mechanics. As a result, WCAG 3.0 is not backwards compatible with WCAG 2.x.</p>
					<p>For content that conforms to the Bronze level:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The total score and score within each of the functional categories MUST be at least 3.5; and</li>
						<li><a>Views</a> and <a>processes</a> MUST NOT have <a>critical failures</a>.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Silver</h4>
					<p>Silver is a higher conformance level that addresses additional outcomes. Some <a href="#holistic-tests">holistic testing</a> is necessary to verify conformance to this level.</p>
					<p>For content that conforms to the Silver level:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>All <a>views</a> MUST satisfy the <a href="#bronze">Bronze</a> criteria; and</li>
						<li>TBD of holistic tests</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Gold</h4>
					<p>Gold is the highest conformance level that addresses the remaining outcomes described in the guidelines. Additional <a href="#holistic-tests">holistic testing</a> is necessary to verify conformance to this level.</p>
					<p>For content that conforms to the Gold level:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>All <a>views</a> MUST satisfy the <a href="#bronze">Bronze</a> criteria; and</li>
						<li>TBD of holistic tests</li>

				<h3>Defining conformance scope</h3>
				<p>Conformance is defined only for <a>processes</a> and <a>views</a>. However, a conformance claim may be made to cover one process and view, a series of processes and views, or multiple related processes and views.  All unique steps in a process MUST be represented in the set of views. Views outside of the process MAY also be included in the scope.</p>
				<p class="ednote">The AG WG and Silver Task Force recognize that representative sampling is an important strategy that large and complex sites use to assess accessibility. While it is not addressed within this document at this time, our intent is to later address it within this document or in a separate document before the guidelines reach the Candidate Recommendation stage. We welcome your suggestions and feedback about the best way to incorporate representative sampling in WCAG 3.0.</p>

				<h3>Conformance requirements</h3>
				<p>In order for technology to <a>conform</a> to WCAG 3.0, the following conformance requirements apply:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><b>Conformance level</b> - Content MUST meet the requirements of the selected <a href="#conformance-levels">conformance level</a>.</li>
					<li><b>Processes and views</b> - Conformance (and conformance level) MUST apply to complete <a>Processes</a> and <a>Views</a>, and MUST NOT exclude any part of a process or view.</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Conformance claims</h3>
				<p>Conformance claims are not required. Authors can conform to WCAG 3.0 without making a claim. The material below describes how to make a conformance claim if that option is chosen.</p>
				<section><h4>Required Components of a Conformance Claim</h4><p>A conformance claim MUST include the following information:</p><ol>
						<li><b>Date</b> of the claim</li>
						<li><b>Guidelines title, version and URI</b> "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 3.0 at ???"</li>
						<li><b>Conformance level</b> satisfied: (Bronze, Silver, or Gold)</li>
					</ol><b>A concise description of the views and processes</b>, such as a list of URIs for which the claim is made, including any state changes which lead to a new view.</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Example conformance claim</h4>
					<p>On 12 August 2020, the following 10 views and 2 processes conform to WCAG 3.0 at a Bronze level. Processes were selected because they are the most common activities on the site and include 4 unique views. The other 6 views are the most commonly used.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Process 1: Order Newsletter (<a href="http://www.example.com">www.example.com</a>, www.example.com/newsletter)</li>
						<li>Process 2: Comment on Blog Post (<a href="http://www.example.com">www.example.com</a>, <a href="http://www.example.com/blog">www.example.com/blog</a>, <a href="http://www.example.com/blog">www.example.com/blog</a> (with comment model open)</li>

			<h2>Differences from WCAG 2</h2>
			<section>
				<h3>Outcomes</h3>
				<p>Outcomes are different from WCAG 2.x success criteria. Compared to success criteria, outcomes are written to be:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>In plain language; </li>
					<li>More understandable by people who are not experts in technology;</li>
					<li>More user-need oriented instead of technology oriented;</li>
					<li>More granular, so there will be more of them; and</li>
					<li>More flexible to allow more tests than the true/false statements of WCAG 2.x. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>The design of outcomes allows more varied needs of people with disabilities than could have been included in WCAG 2.x. </p>
				<p>Methods map approximately to WCAG 2.x Techniques documents.</p>
