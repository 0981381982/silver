			<p><strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14FibeGwnx5eXbu87j1TeY5fBQQ6ZJpH_/view">The easier-to-Use version of Silver (not yet working)</a>.</strong></p>  W3C requires a strictly formatted documents for its purposes. It is more difficult to use, and lacks many features, including search.  This document is intended for people writing standards.  
			
			<p>This is an early Editor's Draft for the Silver Accessibility Guidelines project, published by the Silver Community Group.  The content is <em>only as an example of the structure</em> and <em>is NOT content that is approved by the Community Group.</em></p>
    </section>
		<section id="sotd">
			<p>The Silver Editor's Draft is published as a joint effort of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/silver/wiki/Main_Page">Silver Task Force</a> of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/">Accessibility Guidelines Working Group</a> and of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/silver/">W3C Silver Community Group</a>.

		<section>
			<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
            <p>People with disabilities can face problems using online content and   applications. Disabilities can be permanent, temporary, or recurring limitations</p>
            <p>We need guidelines to: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>identify these barriers encountered by people with disabilities. </li>
              <li>explain how to solve the problems they pose. </li>
            </ul>
			<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/silver/wiki/Silver_Research_Archive#Research_Results" target="blank">research done in 2017-2018</a> by the Silver Task Force, the Silver Community Group, and their academic and corporate research partners was used to identify the key problem statements related to the current accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.x, ATAG 2.0 and UAAG 2.0). See the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1POs7orJ4ALB0bq5_vyo4v8RxDcr-5ctwD1noVgpXuJc/edit#slide=id.gc6f73a04f_0_0">Silver Research Summary slides</a> for more detailed information. These problem statements were used to identify the opportunities for Silver to address that will improve accessibility guidance. 
			</p>
			<p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 was designed to be technology neutral, and has stayed relevant for over 10 years. The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 has been implemented in open source authoring tool communities (chiefly Wordpress and Drupal) with little known uptake in commercial authoring tools. UAAG 2.0 offers useful guidance to user agent developers and has been implemented on an individual success criterion basis. There is no known user agent that has implemented all of UAAG 2.0. These guidelines have normative guidance for content, and helpful implementation advice for authoring tools, user agents and assistive technologies. 
			</p>
			<p>During the year of Silver research, a recurring theme was the popularity and quality of the guidance in WCAG 2.0. Most of the opportunities identified in the research were improvements in the structure and presentation accessibility guidance to improve usability, to support more disability needs, and to improve maintenance. 
			</p>

		<h2>Guidelines (sorted by Principle)</h2>
		<p>These are <em>very early drafts</em> of guidelines based on experiments done with different groups. They are used to illustrate what Silver could look like.  They should not be considered as proposed content of Silver. These guidelines are just samples of potential content.  They are there to show how the structure would work.  They are <em> not</em> content agreed on by the Silver group. </p>  
<section>
<h3>Perceivable</h3>
<p>
Text Spacing: Text spacing can be overridden.  Allow enough space around the text so it can spread out a little.  
</p>
<p>
Visible Labels and Instructions: Every input requires a visible label.  Every group of inputs that work together require visible instructions. The visible indication can be a text label, a graphic, or a combination of the two.  
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Operable</h3>
<p>
Point of Regard:  Preserve the user’s point of regard (what they are looking at) when the content size or window (viewport) size is changed.  
</p>
<p>
Section Headings: Use headings and sub-headings for your text. Section headings — including titles and subtitles — organize words and images on a web page.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Understandable</h3>
<p>
Clear Words: Use common and clear words. Use the most common 1500 words whever possible.  Remove unnecessary words.  Unusual or new terms should have an easily accessed explanation.  
</p>
<p>
Locate the User:  Highlight where people are in a process.  People with disabilities, and all people are helped when they can orient themselves. Show them what they have accomplished so far, and prepare them for next steps.  Avoid being overly specific in the visual representation of the journey to avoid clutter.  
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Robust</h3>
<p>
Identify Human Language: People will understand text better than if the human language is identified in the code.  When language is coded correctly, browsers will correctly show text features such as accent marks, media players will show captions correctly, and text-to-speech software will speak text correctly. 
</p>
<p>
Information and Relationships: Use the correct underlying code to communicate the meaning of a visual appearances.  For example, if it looks like a heading, it should be coded as a heading, l's ists are coded as lists.  
</p>

		<h2>Scoring & Conformance</h2>
<p>Conformance is a complex topic with many parts that work together.  Scoring is more easily understood.  Scoring is "how well did I do?" These Guidelines use a more flexible structure that rewards organizations for doing more to make their products accessible to people with disabilities.  </p>

<p class="ednote">This section is still under development. A more <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wklZRJAIPzdp2RmRKZcVsyRdXpgFbqFF6i7gzCRqldc/edit" target=blank>detailed version of Conformance</a> is available. Comments are welcome. </p>
<section>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<p class="ednote">The goals are based on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/silver/wiki/Silver_Research_Archive" target=blank>Silver research</a> and the results from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/silver/draft-final-report-of-silver/" target=blank>Silver Design Sprint</a>.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Use more flexible measurement that can include broader guidance.</li>
	<li>Product or project-wide conformance instead of page-based so it can be extended beyond web.</li>
	<li>Address “substantially meets” so:
		<ul>
			<li>Organizations are not excessively penalized for bugs that may not have a large impact on the experience of people with disabilities.</li>
			<li>Rapidly updating products can conform</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Remove “accessibility supported” as an author responsibility and provide guidance to authoring tools, browsers and assistive technology developers of the expected behaviors of their products.</li>
	<li>Develop a more flexible method of claiming conformance that is better suited to accommodate dynamic or more regularly updated content.</li>
	<li>Improve tests so that repeated tests get more consistent results.</li>
	<li>Increase potential for automation of tests</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section>
<h3>How Conformance fits into the Information Architecture</h3>
<p><strong>We aren’t losing content, we are restructuring</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Flattening the overall structure of WCAG 2.x
	<ul>
		<li>From: Principle, Guidelines, Success Criteria and Techniques</li>
		<li>To: Guidelines and Methods</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
<li><strong>Guidelines</strong> are general information and intent written in plain language</li>
<li><strong>Methods</strong> are specific examples, instructions, and tests with more technical information</li>
<li>We are adding a <strong>tagging engine</strong> to make it easier for people to find information.</li>
<li>We propose an <strong>API</strong> so people can extract the data to use for their own purposes.</li>
<li>Guidelines will include: 
	<ul>
		<li>updated WCAG 2.1 guidance (technology-specific success criteria will become Methods)
		<li>new guidance written for Silver
		<li>new guidance for task completion testing 
	</ul>
	</li>
<li>Methods are associated with Guidelines.  In general, Methods are technology specific.  
	<ul>
		<li>Methods include tests for the Method.</li>
		<li>Each Guideline will have multiple Methods with existing WCAG Technique guidance or new Methods written for Silver. </li>
		<li>Methods include tests</li>
		<li>Methods contain the point value for the Method or test</li>
		<li>Methods can provide guidance for: 
		<ul>
			<li>User agents
			<li>Authoring tools
			<li>Assistive technology
			<li>Emerging technologies
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Scoring</h3>
<li>Point Scoring systems is divided into categories by functional user need.  A product or project must score minimum points in each category <span class="ednote">Under discussion</span>
<li>Overall levels are bronze, silver, gold (internationally understood).  
<li>Level is assigned by overall score instead of by individual success criteria
This creates incentives for desirable behaviors that go beyond individual pass/fail tests, such as usability testing, task completion, and user research with people with disabilities.
<li>Doing the minimum scores minimum points.  Going beyond the minimum allows the organization to score in the Silver or Gold level.  Some examples of going beyond the minimum are: improving usability for people with disabilities, testing task completion, writing accessibility statements, and involving people with disabilities in the product design.  
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Point System Explainer</h3>
<p class="ednote">This is the least developed part of conformance and still needs work.  The points below are what we have discussed. </p>
<p>
The point system will have a back-end that is public and transparent.  It will define how the points are allocated.  This will not be normally shown to users, but it will be available to regulators, lawyers, judges, disability organizations,  and any other person who cares about the Silver points being allocated fairly.  
</p>
<p>
The value of a Method will be displayed as part of the information architecture so it is easier for designers and developers to know what Methods give the most value.   It allows us to give an incentive for the “best” solutions.  
</p>
<p>
<strong>Factors included in setting the point score:</strong>
The Silver subgroup working on Conformance brainstormed a number of factors that are a part of setting the points.  We listed the ones with consensus below.  The factors can and probably will be weighted differently across all the points (not for each individual Method).  Each factor can be evaluated individually for each Method as noted below.  
</p>
<p>
It should be possible for anyone who is sufficiently interested to see the factors that were considered for each Method, and why the Method achieved the score it did. 
</p>     
</section> 
<section>
<h3>Accessibility Supported</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Authors are not responsible for the browser or assistive technology. While this may not seem supportive, in the long run it will improve overall experience for people with disabilities by standardizing their experience and encouraging user agents and assistive technologies to conform to standards. 
</li>
<li>
Browsers, user agents, and assistive technology receive guidance how their product could help authors meet Silver.  This is included in the Information Architecture prototype.  
</li>
<li>
Tests could be created for user agents that could be integrated with other public webplatform.org test results. 
</li>
</ul>
</section> 
<section>
<h3>Non-Interference</h3>
<p class-"ednote">
The WCAG 2.x series have Non-Interference Success Criteria as part of their conformance.  The need to draw attention to behaviors that completely block people with disabilities has not gone away.  We need a way that this guidance fits into the overall conformance model. 
</p>
<p>
Proposed: Non-interference guidance would apply at the overall environment for the tasks.  All non-interference guidance would have to pass (if applicable) for tasks to become eligible to acquire points through methods.
</p>
<p>
The existing WCAG 2.1 Non-Interference Success Criteria:
<ul>
<li>1.4.2 - Audio Control,
<li>2.1.2 - No Keyboard Trap,
<li>2.3.1 - Three Flashes or Below Threshold, and
<li>2.2.2 - Pause, Stop, Hide.
</ul> 
</section> 
<section>
<h3>Scope of conformance claim</h3>
Conformance is determined by site or project, not by individual page.  The individual organization determines the scope of the claim. Large organizations will probably have more narrow scopes than the entire site or product that they will want to claim (e.g. a newspaper might have a different claim for the crosswords section than for the news articles).
