			<!-- <p class="ednote"><strong>Link to <a href="">The easier-to-use dynamic version of Silver (not yet working)</a>.</strong>  W3C requires strictly formatted documents for its purposes. Many people who are new to accessibility find that format is more difficult to use and that it lacks features like filtering and search.  This document is intended for people writing standards. We recommend the usable version for most people. [This paragraph will be added when we develop that version.] </p> --> 
			
			<p>The Silver Accessibility Guidelines is major revision that will be the successor to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.x.  This specification creates a new framework and guidelines to make web content and applications accessible to people with disabilities, supporting a wider set of user needs, using new approaches to testing, and allowing more frequent maintenance of guidelines to keep pace with accelerating technology change. Each guideline in the new standard will focus on user needs rather than structural features or types of content, and will be supported by technology-specific methods to meet that need. Content that conforms to WCAG 2.2 is expected to substantially conform to a conformance level of the new standard, though the new standard is expected to have many differences from WCAG 2.x. </p>

			<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

			<p>People with disabilities can face problems using online content and applications. Disabilities can be permanent, temporary, or recurring limitations</p>
            <p>We need guidelines to: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>provide requirements that overcome barriers encountered by people with disabilities. </li>
              <li>explain how to solve the problems these barriers pose. </li>
            </ul>
			<p>The Silver Accessibility Guidelines cover a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible. Following these guidelines will make content more accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including accommodations for blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, learning disabilities, cognitive disabilities and combinations of these; but will not address every user need for people with these disabilities. These guidelines address accessibility of web content and applications on desktops, laptops, tablets, mobile devices and emerging technologies on the web such as web XR (augmented, virtual and mixed reality) and voice input. It can be applied to other content addressed by the W3C. Following these guidelines will also often make content more usable to users in general as well as accessible to individuals with disabilities. </p>
			<p>During the year of research conducte by the Silver Community Group and their research partners, a recurring theme was the popularity and quality of the guidance in WCAG 2.0. Most of the opportunities identified in the research were improvements in the structure and presentation of accessibility guidance to:</p>  
			<ul>
			<li>improve usability &mdash; especially for beginners
			<li>support more disability needs that cannot be tested by true/false success criteria
			<li>improve maintenance to keep the guidelines more current
			</ul>

			<section>
			<h3>Scope</h3>
			<p>The goal of the Silver Accessibility Guidlelines is to provide information that can be used to improve the accessibility of products when using the guidelines on a variety of platforms. It will use a different framework to allow it to address more disability needs, address publishing requirements and emerging technologies on the web such as web XR (augmented, virtual and mixed reality) and voice input. It will provide non-normative information about the ways web technologies need to work with authoring tools, user agents, and assistive technologies. This framework is intended to support better coverage across disabilities, and be easier to maintain, so that the new framework will be more durable over time as technologies evolve. This will require development of a new conformance model, engaging policy makers in that process, and testing the model with policy makers from different settings. <span class="ednote">Adapted from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/12/ag-charter#scope">AGWG Charter Scope</a>.</span></p>

			<h3>Relationship to other W3C Guidelines</h3>
			<p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 was designed to be technology neutral, and has stayed relevant for over 10 years. The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 has been implemented in open source authoring tool communities (chiefly Wordpress and Drupal) with little known uptake in commercial authoring tools. UAAG 2.0 offers useful guidance to user agent developers and has been implemented on an individual success criterion basis. There is no known user agent that has implemented all of UAAG 2.0. These guidelines have normative guidance for content and helpful implementation advice for authoring tools, user agents and assistive technologies. 
			</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Silver incorporates but may not be all encompassing of WCAG, ATAG, and UAAG.  
			<li>Silver is not backward compatible with WCAG, ATAG, and UAAG.  
			</ul>
			</section>
			<p>Since the new standard will use a different conformance model, the Working Group expects that some organizations may wish to continue using WCAG 2.x, while others may wish to migrate to the new standard. For those that wish to migrate to the new standard, the Working Group will provide transition support materials, which may use mapping and / or other approaches to facilitate migration. </p>

		<h2>Guidelines</h2>
		<p>Guidelines are requirements that need to be met.  They are <em>normative</em>, which means they are required.  The Methods (listed in the Explanation section for each Guideline) show the ways that the requirement can be met. The Methods for each guideline are more flexible. They are <em>informative</em>, which means they are not requirements, they are techniques, explanations, and tests that an author can use to meet the required guideline. <p>
		<p>WCAG 2.x has normative success criteria as requirements.  The Silver research showed that the structure of normative success criteria was difficult to understand and made it difficult to include needs of people with disabilities that were not conducive to a binary true/false success criterion.  Silver attempts to solve that problem by having Guidelines in plain language that are normative requirements and apply broadly across platforms.  The specific tests to evaluate the Guidelines are in informative Methods.  This solution is intended to provide greater flexibility to include the needs of people with disabilities that could not be included in the WCAG 2.x structure. </p>
		<p>The headings below are guidelines, which map approximately to WCAG 2.x success critera.  The How-to link for each guideline opens explanatory material which maps approximately to WCAG 2.x Understanding.  The Methods for each guideline are linked in the How-to. They map to WCAG 2.x Techniques. The process of migrating information from WCAG 2.x to Silver has just begun. There are samples below to give an example of how the structure works.  You may want to first look at the <a href="explainers/template.html">template for the new content</a> to see the skeleton of the architecture before looking at the early drafts of the guidelines.  </p>
			<table class="OEtable">
			<tr><th>WCAG 2 maps to </th><th>Silver</th></tr>
			<tr><td>Success Criteria</td><td>Guidelines</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Techniques</td><td>Methods</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Understanding</td><td>How-to<td></tr>
			</table>
		<p><a href="explainers/template.html">How to Template</a> and <a href="methods/template.html">Method template</a> give an overview of the structure for content. </p>
		
		<div class="ednote">
		<p>These are <em> early drafts</em> of guidelines. They are used to illustrate what Silver could look like and to test the process of writing content.  These guideline drafts should not be considered as final content of Silver. They are there to show how the structure would work.  As this draft matures, numbering of individual guidelines will be removed to improve overall usability of the guidelines in response to public requests. Guidelines will be identified by unique name. Translations should have an appropriate unique name.  </p>  
		<p>As more content is developed, this section will be a list of normative guidelines with a unique short name, and the text of the requirement written in plain language. To see the overall plan for migrating content from WCAG 2.1 to Silver, see the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aCRXrtmnSSTso-6S_IO9GQ3AKTB4FYt9k92eT_1PWX4/edit

<h3> Headings </h3>
<p>Use headings and sub-headings for your text. Headings — including titles and subtitles — organize words and images on a web page.
</p> 
<p><a href="explainers/SectionHeading.html">Headings How-to</a></p>
<div class="ednote">
<p>Headings is the first guideline that Silver worked on as part of the prototyping process.  It migrated WCAG 2.4.10 Section Headings. It is a draft that illustrate the Silver architecture. It should not be considered finished.  </p>
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Clear Language: </h3>
<p>
	<p>Use clear language that readers easily understand.</p> 
</p>
<p><a href="explainers/ClearWords.html">Clear Language How-to</a></p>
<div class="ednote">
<p>Clear Language is a new guideline proposed by the Cognitive Accessibility Task Force (COGA), and includes research, documents and comments from COGA.  It showcases a proof-of-concept example of a rubric-type test that could not be included in WCAG. </p>

</div>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Visual Contrast</h3>
<p>Provide sufficient contrast between foreground text and its background. 
</p>
<p><a href="explainers/visualContrast.html">Visual Contrast How-to</a></p>
<div class="ednote">
<p>Visual Contrast is a migration from WCAG 2.1 with significant updates: </p>
		<ul>
		<li>New calculations of contrast based on more modern research on color perception.
		<li>Merging the 1.4.3 AA and 1.4.6 AAA levels into one guideline. 
		<li>New test of text contrast.
		<li>At this time, it only includes textual visual contrast. 
		</ul>
<p>We propose changing the name of “Color Contrast” to “Visual Contrast” as a signal of a paradigm change from one about color to one about “perception of light intensity”. The reason for this change is that the understanding of contrast has matured and the available research and body of knowledge has made breakthroughs in advancing the understanding of “visual contrast”.
</p>
<p>
The proposed new guidance more accurately models current research in human visual perception of contrast and light intensity.  The goal is to improve understanding of the functional needs of all users, and more effectively match the needs of those who face barriers accessing content. This new perception-based model is more context dependent than a strict light ratio measurement; results can, for example, vary with size of text and the darkness of the colors or page.
</p>
<p>
This model is more responsive to user needs and allows designers more choice in visual presentation.  It does this by including multi-factor assessment tests which integrate contrast with interrelated elements of visual readability, such as font features.  It includes tests to determine an upper limit of contrast, where elevated contrast may impact usability.

		<h2>Scoring & Conformance</h2>
<p class="ednote">This section is under development. Comments are welcome. </p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>A conformance claim or following the recommended scoring below is optional. </p>
<p>When the Silver Task Force did research with stakeholders of WCAG 2.0, they found that generally, people like the guidance of WCAG, but wanted changes to the structure including the conformance.  The major issues that are addressed in Silver conformance are: </p>
<ul>
<li>Have the conformance better reflect the experience of people with disabilities using the site or product.  It allows an organization to say that "we may not be 100% conformant, but our site or product is very usable by people with disabilities" and they can express that in a meaningful way. By changing the "all or nothing" approach of WCAG success criteria conformance to a percentage based scoring system there is a more nuanced representation of conformance.
<li>Formalize a representative sampling approach to conformance to address the needs of large, complex, or dynamic sites, apps, projects, or products that cannot test every page as required by WCAG 2.x Conformance. We reference specific sections of WCAG-EM to define the representative sampling approach.  
<li>Allow the organization (this includes company, business, non-profit, government) to prioritize what it important for their product for accessibility assessment so that the organization would not fail for bugs that did not have a negative impact on the accessibility of their site or product to users with disabilities.  Many sites will have workflows that are less critical than other portions of the site, and that should be determined by the site owner. 
<li>Ensure that conformance doesn't dis-proportionally favor one disability over another. 
</ul>
<p>Scoring & Conformance is divided into the following sections: <p>
<ul>
<li>Goals
<li>How Conformance fits into the Information Architecture
<li>Scope of conformance claim
<li>Points & Levels
<li>Sampling
<li>Accessibility Supported
</ul>



<section>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<p class="ednote">The goals are based on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/silver/wiki/Silver_Research_Archive" target=blank>Silver research</a>, the results from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/silver/draft-final-report-of-silver/" target=blank>Silver Design Sprint</a>, and input from the Silver Community Group and Task Force.</p>
<ul>
			<li>Make conformance better aligned with the experience of people with disabilities, keeping in mind that people with different disabilities have different experiences.
			<li>Don't elevate the needs of one disability over another disability. 
			<li>Support a measurement and conformance structure that includes guidance for a broad range of disabilities. This includes particular attention to the needs of low vision and cognitive accessibility, whose needs may not fit the true/false statement success criteria of WCAG 2.x.
			<li>Be inclusive of more organizations needs
			<li>Be user oriented instead of page oriented. What is the person trying to do?
			<li>Wherever possible, preserve the organization’s investment in training, tooling and knowledge.
			<li>Support the ability for organizations to define the a logical subset of a site for conformance.</li>
			<li>Develop a more flexible conformance model that addresses the challenges in applying the 2.x conformance model to large, complex, or dynamic websites and web applications
				<ul>
				<li>Help organizations prioritize things that have a greater impact on improving the experience of people with disability. </li>
				<li>Develop a more flexible method of measuring conformance that is better suited to accommodate dynamic or more regularly updated content.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Remove “accessibility supported” as an author responsibility and provide guidance to authoring tools, browsers and assistive technology developers of the expected behaviors of their products.
			<li>Improve tests so that repeated tests get more consistent results.
			<li>Increase potential for automation of tests.
		</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h3>How Conformance fits into the Information Architecture</h3>
<p><strong>We aren’t losing content, we are restructuring</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Flattening the overall structure of WCAG 2.x
	<ul>
		<li>From: Principle, Guidelines, Success Criteria and Techniques</li>
		<li>To: Guidelines and Methods</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
<li><strong>Guidelines</strong> are general information and intent written in plain language</li>
<li><strong>Methods</strong> are specific examples, instructions, and tests with more technical information</li>
<li>We will add a <strong>tagging engine</strong> to make it easier for people to find information by tags.</li>
<li>We want organizations to be able to extract the guideline data to use for their own purposes.</li>
<li>Guidelines will include: 
	<ul>
		<li>updated WCAG 2.1 guidance (technology-specific success criteria will become Methods)
		<li>new guidance written for Silver
		<li>new guidance for task completion testing 
	</ul>
	</li>
<li>Methods are associated with Guidelines.  In general, Methods are technology specific.  
	<ul>
		<li>Methods include tests for the Method.</li>
		<li>Each Guideline will have multiple Methods with existing WCAG Technique guidance or new Methods written for Silver. 
		<li>Methods can include tests for determining the percentage points to apply to the conformance score. See the <a href="#points-levels">Points & Levels</a> section following for details. </li>
		<li>Methods can provide guidance for: 
		<ul>
			<li>User agents
			<li>Authoring tools
			<li>Assistive technology
			<li>Emerging technologies
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Scope of conformance claim</h3>
<p>As technology advances, the WCAG 2 scope of an individual page becomes more limiting.  Organizations need to be able to scope their claims more broadly than a single page. Many apps have dynamic states that are complex and need a more flexible approach to scope. The needs are so varied, that it makes sense to have the organization determine the scope of what they are claiming,as is common in practice today, the individual organization determines the scope of the claim. Large organizations will probably have more narrow scopes than the entire site or product that they will want to claim (e.g. a newspaper might have a different claim for the crosswords section than for the news articles). An app may have a different scope than the main website.  An organization cannot claim conformance for broader scope than they have tested, unless they have followed the rules for representative sampling in the Sampling section.  
</section>
<section>
<h3>Points & Levels</h3>
<p>Each guideline awards a percentage of a point. A perfect accessibility score would be 100%, and a complete failure is 0%. All points count towards an overall total. A minimum for each disability category must be met. The categories are based on the <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/02.01.02_60/en_301549v020102p.pdf">EN301 549 Functional Performance Statements</a>, but will need some additional categories such as needs of people with vestibular disorders and a more granular breakdown of cognitive disability categories.  
</p>
<ul>
<li>This is an additive scoring system. It increases the score for accessibility achievement instead of penalizing for fails.  
<li>Scoring will be by percentage: each guideline will be worth 1 point (100%) -- a complete failure would be worth 0 points 0%. You cannot have a score higher than 1 or lower than 0.  Note that this is a change from scoring by Method to scoring by Guideline overall.  Multiple methods for one guideline don’t gain more points. 
<li>A minimum percentage must be achieved in each disability category, based on the modified <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/02.01.02_60/en_301549v020102p.pdf">EN301 549 Functional Performance Statements</a>. The modifications include disabilities that are not included in EN301 549 like Vestibular Disorders and breaks down the cognitive disability into groups of cognitive disabilities with common needs.  <span class="ednote">Note: Exactly what that minimum percentage is needs to be established by further research to determine the minimum level for each functional performance statement after writing more content and testing it against websites with claiming WCAG 2.x conformance. It can be plugged in later. The goal would be that the majority of sites that meet WCAG AA today to pass this minimum in Silver. </span>
<li>There is no weighting for importance, severity, difficulty (both of difficulty for humans to use and difficulty for coders to implement), or other reason.  
<li>For automated tests, the total passes for that condition are divided by the total instances of the condition.  That gives a percentage response.  
<li>For advanced Silver tests, there will be a mathematical condition that will be a part of the test. For example, a rubric test would have the total points scored divided by the  number of factors. (We need examples of other tests.) 
<li>Once the minimum level is achieved in each category, all of the guidelines that are met to whatever percentage they are met increase the score.  
<li>The total score is averaged by the number of guidelines that apply to give a final percentage.  Typically, if a guideline isn’t used (or is not applicable), then you don’t divide by that one. For example, if a site has no video or audio, the captioning guideline is not applicable. Some guidelines, like Flashing Content, may need a way to include their score, since there should be credit given for not having flashing content.  
<li>If you are using sampling (see the following section), then the score is by the pages or screens tested.  
</ul>
<p>The overall points total contribute to the level of conformance achieved. 
Bronze is the lowest level of conformance, Silver is the middle level of conformance, and Gold is the highest level of conformance that can be met. Higher point totals will be needed to reach higher levels of conformance. <span class="ednote">We will need more research to determine where the break points will be.</span>  
</p>
<p>
Note: We have chosen these level names since they have international understanding and are easily translated.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Sampling</h3>
<p>
Sampling helps give confidence whether people building the product, app, site, or digital property have done the accessibility work that makes the product more accessible to people with disabilities. Sampling gives an indication of where you are in accessibility, but it doesn't guarentee that you have found every problem.  It is particularly effective when a product or site is built with accessible components. The more a site is generated from a set of components, the more you want to get those components accessible.  </p>
<p>
Representative sampling is a way to assess large properties without having to test every screen. Representative sampling is common in accessibility testing, partcularly for manual testing.  Sampling is optional. Anyone who wants to test all their pages or screens can do so. 
</p>
<p>There are a number of approaches to sampling. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-EM/">Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM) 1.0)</a> is web-oriented, but the principles can be applied more broadly. 
</p>

<h4>Highlights from WCAG-EM selecting representative samples</h4>
<p>All of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-EM/">Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM) 1.0)</a> has helpful information.  See the following sections on choosing a representative sample for more detail. They will need minor modifications to make them more broadly applicable than Web Pages.   
<ul class="nobullet">

</ul>

<h4>Different sample size requirements for different sized products</h4>
<ul>

<li>Sites from 11 - 100 pages or products with 11 - 100 screens (including counting the different dynamic states)

<h4>Notes from discussion</h4>
<ul>
<li>Essential functions vary by industry -- gaming will be different than e-commerce. We can't say what has to be tested, the organization needs to determine what is essential. 
<li>The organization (company, non-profit) defines the workflows and components, then prioritizes the primary workflows and components  to test. See WCAG-EM Steps 2 and 3 to help determine what workflows and components are representative samples.  
<li>The ability to get to the workflow, (like login) also must be accessible. 
<li>There are going to be technical violations of success criteria that don’t impact accessibility (for example, missing alt text that are explained in the text or the same HTML id attribute that aren’t ever referenced) that shouldn’t negatively impact the score. <span class="ednote">NOTE: There will be further development and amplification of what shouldn’t negatively impact the score. The concept of pass or fail should no longer be binary, but accounts for a concept of sufficient</span>  
<li>People still need to have access to material that still isn’t in the primary flow. Accessibility can be tested even if it doesn’t have a flow.  <span class="ednote">NOTE: There needs to be a way that important sections, like navigation and footer, don’t get overlooked because they aren’t part of the flow.  </span>

<h3>Scoring</h3>
<li>Point Scoring systems is divided into categories by functional user need.  A product or project must score minimum points in each category <span class="ednote">Under discussion</span>
<li>Overall levels are bronze, silver, gold (internationally understood).  
<li>Level is assigned by overall score instead of by individual success criteria
This creates incentives for desirable behaviors that go beyond individual pass/fail tests, such as usability testing, task completion, and user research with people with disabilities.
<li>Doing the minimum scores minimum points.  Going beyond the minimum allows the organization to score in the Silver or Gold level.  Some examples of going beyond the minimum are: improving usability for people with disabilities, testing task completion, writing accessibility statements, and involving people with disabilities in the product design.  
</ul>

<h3>Point System Explainer</h3>
<p class="ednote">This is the least developed part of conformance and still needs work.  The points below are what we have discussed. </p>
<p>
The point system will have a back-end that is public and transparent.  It will define how the points are allocated.  This will not be normally shown to users, but it will be available to regulators, lawyers, judges, disability organizations,  and any other person who cares about the Silver points being allocated fairly.  
</p>
<p>
The value of a Method will be displayed as part of the information architecture so it is easier for designers and developers to know what Methods give the most value.   It allows us to give an incentive for the “best” solutions.  
</p>
<p>
<strong>Factors included in setting the point score:</strong>
The Silver subgroup working on Conformance brainstormed a number of factors that are a part of setting the points.  We listed the ones with consensus below.  The factors can and probably will be weighted differently across all the points (not for each individual Method).  Each factor can be evaluated individually for each Method as noted below.  
</p>
<p>
It should be possible for anyone who is sufficiently interested to see the factors that were considered for each Method, and why the Method achieved the score it did.

<h3>Accessibility Supported</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Authors are not responsible for the browser or assistive technology. While this may not seem supportive, in the long run it will improve overall experience for people with disabilities by standardizing their experience and encouraging user agents and assistive technologies to conform to standards. This advice will be non-normative suggestions.  <span class="ednote"> Needs more work in phrasing. </span>
</li>
<li>
Browsers, user agents, and assistive technology receive guidance how their product could help authors meet Silver.  This is included in the Information Architecture prototype.  
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Non-Interference</h3>
<p class="ednote">
The WCAG 2.x series have Non-Interference Success Criteria as part of their conformance.  The need to draw attention to behaviors that completely block people with disabilities has not gone away.  We need a way that this guidance fits into the overall conformance model. 
</p>
<p>
Proposed: Non-interference guidance would apply at the overall environment for the tasks.  All non-interference guidance would have to pass (if applicable) for tasks to become eligible to acquire points through methods.
</p>
<p>
The existing WCAG 2.1 Non-Interference Success Criteria:
<ul>
<li>1.4.2 - Audio Control,
<li>2.1.2 - No Keyboard Trap,
<li>2.3.1 - Three Flashes or Below Threshold, and
<li>2.2.2 - Pause, Stop, Hide.
</ul>
