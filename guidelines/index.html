			<p>This is an Editor's Draft for the Silver Accessibility Guidelines project, published by the Silver Community Group.  This document illustrates: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>structural changes from prior versions</li>
				<li>examples of content updates </li>
				<li>conformance model</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The purpose of this draft is to get feedback and discussion to inform and refine the structure and conformance model.  We expect feedback and discussion as part of the public review. The content is <em>only an example of the structure</em> and <em>is not content that is approved by the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (AGWG).</em> The Silver task force and AGWG will continue to expand this draft while addressing public comments.  Revisions will be announced and user testing will be conducted.</p>
			<p>The Silver Editor's Draft is published as a joint effort of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/silver/wiki/Main_Page">Silver Task Force</a> of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/">Accessibility Guidelines Working Group</a> and of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/silver/">W3C Silver Community Group</a>.

			<p>People with disabilities can face problems using online content and applications. Disabilities can be permanent, temporary, or recurring limitations</p>
            <p>We need guidelines to: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Provide requirements that overcome barriers encountered by people with disabilities. </li>
              <li>Explain how to solve the problems these barriers pose. </li>
            </ul>
			<p>The Silver Accessibility Guidelines cover a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible. Following these guidelines will make content more accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including accommodations for blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, learning disabilities, cognitive disabilities and combinations of these; but will not address every user need for people with these disabilities. These guidelines address accessibility of web content and applications on desktops, laptops, tablets, mobile devices and emerging technologies on the web such as web XR (augmented, virtual and mixed reality) and voice input. It can be applied to other content addressed by the W3C. Following these guidelines will also often make content more usable to users in general as well as accessible to individuals with disabilities. </p>
			<p>During the year of research conducte by the Silver Community Group and their research partners, a recurring theme was the popularity and quality of the guidance in WCAG 2.0. Most of the opportunities identified in the research were improvements in the structure and presentation of accessibility guidance to:</p>  
			<ul>
			<li>improve usability — especially for beginners
			</li><li>support more disability needs that cannot be tested by true/false success criteria
			</li><li>improve maintenance to keep the guidelines more current
			</li></ul>

			<p>The goal of the Silver Accessibility Guidlelines is to provide information that can be used to improve the accessibility of products when using the guidelines on a variety of platforms. It will use a different framework to allow it to address more disability needs, address publishing requirements and emerging technologies on the web such as web XR (augmented, virtual and mixed reality) and voice input. It will provide non-normative information about the ways web technologies need to work with authoring tools, user agents, and assistive technologies. This framework is intended to support better coverage across disabilities, and be easier to maintain, so that the new framework will be more durable over time as technologies evolve. This will require development of a new conformance model, engaging policy makers in that process, and testing the model with policy makers from different settings. <span class="note">Adapted from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/12/ag-charter#scope">AGWG Charter Scope</a>.</span></p>

			<p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 was designed to be technology neutral, and has stayed relevant for over 10 years. The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 has been implemented in open source authoring tool communities (chiefly Wordpress and Drupal) with little known uptake in commercial authoring tools. UAAG 2.0 offers useful guidance to user agent developers and has been implemented on an individual success criterion basis. There is no known user agent that has implemented all of UAAG 2.0. These guidelines have normative guidance for content and helpful implementation advice for authoring tools, user agents and assistive technologies.

			<ul>
			<li>Silver incorporates but may not be all encompassing of WCAG, ATAG, and UAAG.  
			</li><li>Silver is not backward compatible with WCAG, ATAG, and UAAG.  
			</li></ul>
			</section>
			<p>Since the new standard will use a different conformance model, the Working Group expects that some organizations may wish to continue using WCAG 2.x, while others may wish to migrate to the new standard. For those that wish to migrate to the new standard, the Working Group will provide transition support materials, which may use mapping and / or other approaches to facilitate migration. </p>

		<p>Guidelines are requirements that need to be met.  They are <em>normative</em>, which means they are required.  The Methods (listed in the Explanation section for each Guideline) show the ways that the requirement can be met. The Methods for each guideline are more flexible. They are <em>informative</em>, which means they are not requirements, they are techniques, explanations, and tests that an author can use to meet the required guideline. </p><p>
		</p><p>WCAG 2.x has normative success criteria as requirements.  The Silver research showed that the structure of normative success criteria was difficult to understand and made it difficult to include needs of people with disabilities that were not conducive to a binary true/false success criterion.  Silver attempts to solve that problem by having Guidelines in plain language that are normative requirements and apply broadly across platforms.  The specific tests to evaluate the Guidelines are in informative Methods.  This solution is intended to provide greater flexibility to include the needs of people with disabilities that could not be included in the WCAG 2.x structure. </p>
		<p>The headings below are guidelines, which map approximately to WCAG 2.x success critera.  The How-to link for each guideline opens explanatory material which maps approximately to WCAG 2.x Understanding.  The Methods for each guideline are linked in the How-to. They map to WCAG 2.x Techniques. The process of migrating information from WCAG 2.x to Silver has just begun. There are samples below to give an example of how the structure works.

<p>Visual Contrast is a migration from WCAG 2.1 with significant updates: </p>
		<ul>
		<li>New calculations of contrast based on more modern research on color perception.
		</li><li>Merging the 1.4.3 AA and 1.4.6 AAA levels into one guideline. 
		</li><li>New test of text contrast.
		</li><li>At this time, it only includes textual visual contrast. 
		</li></ul>
<p>We propose changing the name of “Color Contrast” to “Visual Contrast” as a signal of a paradigm change from one about color to one about “perception of light intensity”. The reason for this change is that the understanding of contrast has matured and the available research and body of knowledge has made breakthroughs in advancing the understanding of “visual contrast”.
</p>
<p>
The proposed new guidance more accurately models current research in human visual perception of contrast and light intensity.  The goal is to improve understanding of the functional needs of all users, and more effectively match the needs of those who face barriers accessing content. This new perception-based model is more context dependent than a strict light ratio measurement; results can, for example, vary with size of text and the darkness of the colors or page.
</p>
<p>
This model is more responsive to user needs and allows designers more choice in visual presentation.  It does this by including multi-factor assessment tests which integrate contrast with interrelated elements of visual readability, such as font features.  It includes tests to determine an upper limit of contrast, where elevated contrast may impact usability.

<h3 id="introduction-0">Introduction<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#scoring-and-conformance"></a></h3>
<p>A conformance claim or following the recommended scoring below is optional. </p>
<p>When the Silver Task Force researched WCAG 2.0, they found that, generally, people like WCAG guidance but wanted changes to the structure, including the conformance. The major issues that Silver conformance addresses are: </p>
<ul>
<li>Make the site or product's conformance better reflect the needs and experiences of people with disabilities. Change from the "all-or-nothing-to-pass" method of WCAG conformance to scores based on percentage, so organizations can show their degree of conformance. This allows an organization to say: "Our product or site may not be 100% conformant, but it's usable by people with disabilities."
</li><li>Use a "representative sampling" conformance method to address the needs of large, complex, or dynamic sites, apps, projects, or products. In these cases, organizations can't test every page as WCAG 2.x Conformance requires. We refer to specific sections of WCAG-EM to define the representative sampling approach.  
</li><li>Allow organizations to decide the important parts of their products or sites to assess for accessibility. Some sites may have workflows that are less critical than other portions of their product, site, or app. Thus, it wouldn't fail accessibility tests if it has bugs that don't impact its accessibility or its users with disabilities.
</li><li>Ensure that conformance doesn't favor any disability over another. 
</li></ul>
<p>Scoring and Conformance is divided into the following sections: </p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Goals
</li><li>How Conformance fits into the Information Architecture
</li><li>Scope of conformance claim
</li><li>Points and Levels

			</li><li>Support a measurement and conformance structure that includes guidance for a broad range of disabilities. This includes more attention to the needs of low vision and cognitive accessibility, whose needs may not fit the true/false statement success criteria of WCAG 2.x. 
			</li><li>Consider the needs of more organizations
			</li><li>Be user-oriented instead of page-oriented. Think about what is the person trying to do.
			</li><li>Wherever possible, preserve the organization’s investment in training, tooling, and knowledge.

			<li>Create a more flexible conformance model that addresses the challenges in applying the 2.x conformance model to large, complex, or dynamic websites and web applications.
				<ul>
				<li>Help organizations prioritize things that have a greater impact on improving the experience of people with disability.  </li>
				<li>Develop a more flexible method of measuring conformance that is better suited to accommodate dynamic or more regularly updated content.</li>
				</ul>
			</li><li>Remove “accessibility supported” as an author responsibility, and help developers of authoring tools, browsers, and assistive technologies learn the behaviors that users expect of their products. 
			</li><li>Improve tests so that repeated tests get more consistent results.
			</li><li>Increase the ability to create more automated tests.

<p>As technology advances, the WCAG 2.x scope of an individual page becomes more limiting and a flexible way is needed. Needs vary by factors that include but are not limited to: size; complexity; dynamic content; statefulness; frequency of publishing; third-party integrations; custom and scoped web components; critical user flows; etc.
</p>
<p>
The organization (author) should consider its own factors and determine the scope of what they are claiming. This allows the scope of the claim to be narrower than the entire site or product. Examples: a newspaper might have a different claim for the crosswords section than for the news section; or an app may have a different scope than the main website. 
</p>
<p>
An organization can't claim conformance for broader scope than they have identified and tested, unless they have followed the rules for representative sampling in the Sampling section.

<section id="points-and-levels">
<h3 id="x3-4-points-and-levels"><bdi class="secno">3.4 </bdi>Points and Levels<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#points-and-levels"></a></h3>
<p>Each guideline awards a percentage of a point. A perfect accessibility score would be 100%, and a complete failure is 0%. All points count towards an overall total. The site or product tested must meet a minimum score for each disability category. The categories are based on the <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/02.01.02_60/en_301549v020102p.pdf">EN301 549 Functional Performance Statements</a>, but will need more categories such as needs of people with vestibular disorders and a detailed breakdown of cognitive disability categories.  
</p>
<ul>
<li>This is an additive scoring system. It increases the score for meeting each accessibility guideline instead of penalizing for fails.  
</li><li>Scoring will be by percentage: each guideline will be worth 1 point (100%) -- a complete failure would be worth 0 points (0%). Each guideline cannot have a score higher than 1 or lower than 0. Multiple methods for one guideline don’t gain more points. 
</li><li>The scope tested must score a minimum percentage in each disability category, based on the modified EN301 549 Functional Performance Statements. <span class="note">Note: We'll continue to research the minimum percentage for each functional performance statement, after writing more content and testing it against websites that claim WCAG 2.x conformance. This will allow most sites that meet WCAG 2.x AA today to pass this minimum in Silver. </span>
</li><li>Once the minimum level is achieved in each category, all of the guidelines that are met to whatever percentage they are met increase the score.  
</li><li>There is no weighting for importance, severity, difficulty (both of difficulty for humans to use and difficulty for coders to implement), or other reason.  
</li><li>Different guidelines will evaluate the site or product by different measures.  Some will apply to the entire site or product, others may apply by the page or screen. Many will apply to the number of instances of the element.  
</li><li>How the percentage is calculated will change by the guideline.  For  example, if a guideline score is calculated by instances of an element (like total number of images), then the total passes for that condition are divided by the total instances of the condition.  That gives a percentage response.  
</li><li>For advanced Silver tests, there will be a mathematical condition that will be a part of the test. For example, a rubric test would have the total points scored divided by the  number of factors. <span class="note">(We need examples of other tests.)</span> 
</li><li>The total score is averaged by the number of guidelines that apply to give a final percentage.  Typically, if a guideline isn’t used (or isn't applicable), then you don’t divide by that one. For example, if a site has no video or audio, the captioning guideline isn't applicable. <span class="note">Some guidelines, like Flashing Content, will need a way to include their score, since there should be credit given for not having flashing content. </span> 
</li><li>If the tester uses sampling (see the following section), then the score is set by the pages or screens tested.  
</li></ul>
<p>The overall points total contribute to the level of conformance achieved. 
Bronze is the lowest level of conformance; Silver is the middle level of conformance; and Gold is the highest level of conformance that can be met. Higher point totals will be needed to reach higher levels of conformance. <span class="note">We'll need more research to determine where the break points will be.</span>  
</p>
<p>
Note: We've chosen these level names since they’re understood internationally  and are easily translated.

<section id="sampling">
<h3 id="x3-5-sampling"><bdi class="secno">3.5 </bdi>Sampling<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#sampling"></a></h3>
<p>
Sampling helps give confidence whether people building the product, app, site, or digital property have done the accessibility work that makes the product more accessible to people with disabilities. Sampling gives an indication of where you are in accessibility, but it doesn't guarantee that the tester finds every problem.  It's particularly effective when a product or site is built with accessible components. The more a site is created from a set of components, the more you want to get those components accessible.  </p>
<p>
Representative sampling is a way to assess large properties without having to test every screen. Representative sampling is common in accessibility testing, partcularly for manual testing.  Sampling is optional. Anyone who wants to test all their pages or screens can do so. 
</p>
<p>There are many approaches to sampling. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-EM/">Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM) 1.0)</a> is web-oriented, but the principles can be applied more broadly.
