			<p>W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0 provides a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible to users with disabilities. Following these guidelines will address many of the needs of users with blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, learning disabilities and cognitive limitations, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these. These guidelines address accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, mobile devices, and wearable and other Web of Things devices. They address various types of web content including static content, interactive content, visual and auditory media, and virtual and augmented reality. The guidelines also address related web tools such as user agents (browsers and assistive technologies), content management systems, authoring tools, and testing tools.</p>
			<p>Each <a>guideline</a> in this standard addresses <a>functional outcomes</a> of accessibility practices that address documented <a>user needs</a> of people with disabilities. Guidelines are supported by multiple alternative technology-specific <a>methods</a> to meet each need. This specification is expected to be updated regularly to keep pace with technology change, both by updating or adding methods as well as adding guidelines to address new needs as technologies evolve. For entities that make formal claims of <a>conformance</a> to these guidelines, several grades of conformance are available to address the diverse nature of digital content and the type of testing that is performed.</p>
			<p>W3C Accessibility Guidelines 3.0 is a successor to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2</a> [[WCAG22]] and previous versions. They also incorporate content from and partially extend <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/">User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [[UAAG20]] and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [[ATAG20]]. Content that conforms to WCAG 2.2 is expected to substantially conform to a conformance level of WCAG 3.0, though these guidelines have many differences from WCAG 2.x. WCAG 3.0 does not supersede WCAG 2.2 and previous versions; rather, it is an alternative and more modern set of guidelines. Once these guidelines become a W3C Recommendation, the W3C will advise the use of WCAG 3.0 to maximize future applicability of accessibility efforts, as well as when developing or updating Web accessibility policies. However, web sites that conform to earlier versions of
				WCAG continue to conform to those versions.</p>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>This specification creates a new framework and guidelines to make web content and applications accessible to people with disabilities. W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0 supports a wide set of user needs, uses new approaches to testing, and allows frequent maintenance of guidelines to keep pace with accelerating technology change. WCAG 3.x continues this evolution by focusing on users’ functional needs. These are then supported by technology-specific methods to meet that need. </p>
			<p>Following these guidelines will make content more accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities. This includes accommodations for blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, learning disabilities, cognitive disabilities and combinations of these. Following these guidelines will also often make content more usable to users in general as well as accessible to individuals with disabilities.</p>
			<p>There are many differences between WCAG 2.x and WCAG 3.x but content that conforms to WCAG 2.2 A &amp; AA is expected to substantially conform to the minimum conformance level of this new standard. Since the new standard will use a different conformance model, the Working Group expects that some organizations may wish to continue using WCAG 2.x, while others may wish to migrate to the new standard. For those that wish to migrate to the new standard, the Working Group will provide transition support materials, which may use mapping and / or other approaches to facilitate migration.</p>
			<section><h3>Scope of WCAG 3.0</h3><p>During the year of research conducted by the Silver Community Group and their research partners, a recurring theme was the popularity and quality of the guidance in WCAG 2.0. Most of the opportunities identified in the research were improvements in the structure and presentation of accessibility guidance to:</p><ul>
					<li>improve usability — especially for beginners;</li>
					<li>support more disability needs that cannot be tested by true/false success criteria; and</li>
					<li>improve maintenance to keep the guidelines more current.</li>
				</ul>The goal of WCAG 3.0 is to provide information that can be used to improve the accessibility of products when using the guidelines on a variety of platforms. It uses a different framework to allow it to address more disability needs, address publishing requirements and emerging technologies on the web such as web XR (augmented, virtual and mixed reality) and voice input. It will provide non-<a>normative</a> information about the ways web technologies need to work with authoring tools, user agents, and assistive technologies. This framework is intended to support better coverage across disabilities and be easier to maintain, so that the new framework will be more durable over time as technologies evolve. This will require development of a new conformance model, engaging policy makers in that process, and testing the model with policy makers from different settings.</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Relationship to Other W3C Guidelines</h3>
				<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</a> [[WCAG20]] was designed to be technology neutral, and has stayed relevant for over 10 years. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0</a> [[ATAG20]] has been implemented in open source authoring tool communities (chiefly Wordpress and Drupal) with little known uptake in commercial authoring tools. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/">User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) 2.0</a> [[UAAG20]] offers useful guidance to user agent developers and has been implemented on an individual success criterion basis. There is no known user agent that has implemented all of UAAG 2.0. </p>
				<p>These guidelines have normative guidance for content and helpful implementation advice for authoring tools, user agents and assistive technologies.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>WCAG 3.0 incorporates but may not be all encompassing of WCAG, ATAG, and UAAG.</li>
					<li>WCAG 3.0 is not backward compatible with WCAG 2.0, ATAG 2.0, and UAAG 2.0.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Key Requirements</h3>
				<p>Research and design work performed by the Silver Task Force identified key requirements needed to improve upon the existing WCAG 2.x structure. These requirements shaped the conformance proposal that follows and should be taken into account when evaluating and updating this proposal.</p>

			<h2>Structure of These Guidelines</h2>
			<p>WCAG 3.0 is organized by <a>Functional Categories</a> of disabilities which reflect the diverse needs of users with disabilities. Within each Functional Category, Functional Needs are applied to specific topics (for example: contrast, forms, readability, and more)  to identify the barriers experienced by people with disabilities. The barriers in these topics inform the Functional Outcomes, which state the conditions to test whether the Functional Needs have been met.  </p>
				<p class="ednote">The work of cataloging functional needs is still in process and will continue after the First Public Working Draft.  Those interested can see more information in this draft Google document <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eJkgXqbh7dx3uD6XAy8XAANmwfbbVZ5GKb_gbsUdkVs/">Functional Needs - Expanded</a></p>

				<p><a>Functional Outcomes</a> are the results of practices that reduce or eliminate barriers that people with disabilities experience. Functional Outcomes form the basis of a flexible and expansive architecture for accessibility guidelines that relates closely to the needs of people with disabilities. Specific tests can be used to assess the accessibility of common technologies and the overall Functional Outcome can be used to assess proprietary and new technologies. </p>

			<h2>The Guidelines</h2>
			<p>@@Intro about including both material from WCAG 2 as well as new content</p>

			<p class="ednote">The process of migrating information from WCAG 2.x to WCAG 3.0 has just begun. This document presents initial examples of how the structure works. The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/silver/guidelines/explainers/template.html">template for the new content</a> presents the skeleton of the architecture and may help . We welcome comments on this. </p>
			<p class="ednote">These are early drafts of guidelines. They are used to illustrate what WCAG 3.0 could look like and to test the process of writing content. These guideline drafts should not be considered as final content of WCAG 3.0. They are there to show how the structure would work. As this draft matures, numbering of individual guidelines will be removed to improve overall usability of the guidelines in response to public requests. </p>
			<p>As more content is developed, this section will be a list of normative guidelines with a unique short name, and the text of the requirement written in plain language. To see the overall plan for migrating content from WCAG 2.1 to WCAG 3.0, see the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aCRXrtmnSSTso-6S_IO9GQ3AKTB4FYt9k92eT_1PWX4/edit">WCAG to Silver Outline Map</a>.</p>

			<p>The Guidelines included in this draft have been selected to show different types of content:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Text Alternatives - a direct migration from WCAG 2.x success criterion</p></li>
				<li><p>Visual Contrast of Text - a migration of WCAG 2.x with substantial changes</p></li>
				<li><p>Structured Content - migration and merging of several previously unrelated WCAG 2.x success criteria</p></li>
				<li><p>Clear Language - new guidance that could not previously be included in WCAG 2.x</p></li>
				<li><p>Captions - an example of adapting WCAG 2.x guidance to emerging technologies, such as Web Virtual Reality</p></li>

				<h3>Visual Contrast of Text</h3>
				<p>Provide sufficient contrast between foreground text and its background.</p>
				<p><a href="https://w3c.github.io/silver/guidelines/explainers/visualContrast.html">Visual Contrast of Text How-to</a></p>
				<div class="ednote">
					<p>Visual Contrast is a migration from WCAG 2.1 with significant updates:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>New calculations of contrast based on more modern research on color perception.</li>
						<li>Merging the 1.4.3 AA and 1.4.6 AAA levels into one guideline.</li>
						<li>New test of text contrast.</li>
						<li>At this time, it only includes textual visual contrast.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>We propose changing the name of “Color Contrast” to “Visual Contrast” as a signal of a paradigm change from one about color to one about “perception of light intensity”. The reason for this change is that the understanding of contrast has matured and the available research and body of knowledge has made breakthroughs in advancing the understanding of “visual contrast”.</p>
				<p>The proposed new guidance more accurately models current research in human visual perception of contrast and light intensity. The goal is to improve understanding of the functional needs of all users, and more effectively match the needs of those who face barriers accessing content. This new perception-based model is more context dependent than a strict light ratio measurement; results can, for example, vary with size of text and the darkness of the colors or page.</p>
				<p>This model is more responsive to user needs and allows designers more choice in visual presentation. It does this by including multi-factor assessment tests which integrate contrast with interrelated elements of visual readability, such as font features. It includes tests to determine an upper limit of contrast, where elevated contrast may impact usability.</p>
			</section>

			<h2>Evaluation</h2>
			<p class="ednote">We continue to test this approach and others for validity, reliability, sensitivity, and adequacy, and complexity.  Alternatives that we are exploring are noted as separate editor’s notes where applicable. We welcome suggestions on ways to improve the scoring to better meet these criteria.</p>
			<section>
				<h3>Testing</h3>
				<p>WCAG 3.0 includes two types of tests:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Traditional tests include the tests that support A, AA, and AAA Success Criteria in WCAG 2.x. In WCAG 3.0, these tests support functional outcomes and lead to a Bronze rating. In most cases, testing individual elements will result in binary, pass/fail outcome for that element. These results are then used to assign a score to each functional outcome.  </li>
					<li>Holistic tests include assistive technology testing, user-centered design methods, and both user and expert usability testing.  Holistic testing applies to the entire declared scope and often uses the declared processes to guide the tests selected.  Holistic tests are used to reach a Silver or Gold rating.</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section><h3>Scoring</h3><p class="ednote">One the goals of WCAG 3.0 is to expand scoring tests of methods beyond a binary true/false choice at the page level. We have included tests within the sample functional outcomes that demonstrate alternatives such as rubrics and scales.We are also exploring integrating these options into <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/">Accessibility Conformance Testing</a> format. We will include example tests in a future draft. Our intent is to include detailed <a href="https://w3c.github.io/silver/requirements/#multiple-ways-to-measure">tests for methods</a> to support each functional outcome within the WCAG 3.0 framework . </p><p>Each functional outcome has methods associated with different technologies. Each method contains tests and techniques for meeting that functional outcome.  Testers can test the accessibility of new and emerging technologies that do not have related methods based on the functional
					outcome. </p><p>Tests are applied at the view level and can be scored in one of three ways which will be included in the test statement:</p><ul>
					<li>Pass/Fail (100%/0%)</li>
					<li>Rating Scale (0 (0%), 1 (20%), 2 (40%), 3 (60%), 4 (80%), and 5 (100%)</li>
					<li>Percentage (# passed/total # of instances)</li>
				</ul>Testers then aggregate the results of related tests across the views and count the number of <a>critical failures</a> that occur. Testers will then use the guidelines below along with reasonable judgement of the context to assign a rating:<ul>
					<li>Very Poor (0) = Any critical failures or less than 50% of related tests fail</li>
					<li>Poor (1) = No critical failures, ~50-79%</li>
					<li>Fair (2) = No critical failures, ~80-89%</li>
					<li>Good  (3) = No critical failures, ~90-98%</li>
					<li>Excellent (4) = No critical failures, ~99%-100%</li>
				</ul><p>The ratings given to functional outcomes are then averaged for a total score and a score by the functional category(ies) they support.  Conformance at the Bronze level require no critical failures and at least 3.5 score within each functional category and overall. </p><p class="ednote">This approach, which allows the tester some flexibility in assigning scores, has the advantage of simplicity and allowing a tester to take the context into account beyond the simple percentages. The second option we are exploring is to carry percentages from tests through to a final score. In this case a Bronze rating would require a total score of at least 90% and at least 90% within each functional need category. This number will likely shift as we continue testing.  We invite comment on these options as well as suggestions for an alternative solution. </p></section>

			<h2>Conformance</h2>
			<p>@@Introductory text about you don’t have to conform, but if you want to claim conformance here’s how; we recommend following the steps even if not making a formal claim.</p>
			<section>
				<h3>Conformance Requirements</h3>
				<p>In order for technology to <a>conform</a> to WCAG 3.0, all of the following conformance requirements must be satisfied:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><b>Conformance Level</b> - One of the following conformance levels is met in full: <ul>
							<li><b>Bronze</b> - For Bronze level conformance (the minimum level of conformance): <ul>
									<li>The total score and score within each of the functional categories is at least 3.5</li>
									<li>Views and paths include no <a>critical errors</a>.</li>
								</ul></li>
							<li><b>Silver</b> - For Silver level conformance: <ul>
									<li>All views satisfy Bronze criteria</li>
									<li>TBD of holistic tests</li>
								</ul></li>
							<li><b>Gold</b> - For Gold level conformance: <ul>
									<li>Meets Bronze criteria</li>
									<li>TBD of holistic tests</li>
								</ul></li>
						</ul></li>
					<li><b>Processes and Views</b> - Conformance (and conformance level) is for complete <a>Processes</a> and <a>Views</a>, and cannot be achieved if part of a process or view is excluded.</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Defining Conformance Scope</h3>
				<p>Conformance is defined only for <a>processes</a> and <a>views</a>. However, a conformance claim may be made to cover one process and view, a series of processes and views, or multiple related processes and views.  All unique steps in a process must be represented in the set of views. Views outside of the process may also be included in the scope.</p>
				<p class="ednote">The AG WG and Silver Task Force recognize that representative sampling is an important strategy that large and complex sites use to assess accessibility. While it is not addressed within this document at this time, our intent is to later address it within this document or in a separate document before the guidelines reach the Candidate Recommendation stage. We welcome your suggestions and feedback about the best way to incorporate representative sampling in WCAG 3.0.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Conformance Claims</h3>
				<p>Conformance claims are not required. Authors can conform to WCAG 3.0 without making a claim. The material below describes how to make a conformance claim if that option is chosen.</p>
				<section><h4>Required Components of a Conformance Claim</h4><p>A conformance claim MUST include the following information:</p><ol>
						<li><b>Date</b> of the claim</li>
						<li><b>Guidelines title, version and URI</b> "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 3.0 at ???"</li>
						<li><b>Conformance level</b> satisfied: (Bronze, Silver, or Gold)</li>
					</ol><b>A concise description of the views and processes</b>, such as a list of URIs for which the claim is made, including any state changes which lead to a new view.</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Example Conformance Claim</h4>
					<p>On 12 August 2020, the following 10 views and 2 paths conform to WCAG 3.0 at a Bronze level. Paths were selected because they are the most common activities on the site and include 4 unique views. The other 6 views are additional commonly used pages.</p>

				<dd><p>All content visually and programatically available without a substantive change.  Defining views will vary based on the technology being tested. While we provide guidance on scoping a view, the tester will make and declare the decisions and these will often vary by technology.  Views typically include state permutations that are based on that view such as dialogs and alerts; however some states may deserve to be treated as separate views. </p></dd>

				<h3>Functional Outcomes</h3>
				<p>Functional Outcomes are different from WCAG 2.x Success Criteria. Compared to Success Criteria, Functional Outcomes are written to be:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>in plain language; </li>
					<li> More understandable by people who are not experts in technology;</li>
					<li>More user-need oriented instead of technology oriented;</li>
					<li>More granular, so there will be more of them;</li>
					<li>More flexible to allow more tests than the true/false statements of WCAG 2.x. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>The design of Functional Outcomes allows more varied needs of people with disabilities than could have been included in WCAG 2.x. </p>
				<p>Methods map approximately to WCAG 2.x Techniques documents.</p>
