# WCAG 3.0 How-To

How-tos are created for every guideline. They are stored in this directory, with one sub-directory per how-to. Within each directory, content is added to a set of standard simple HTML files. A generator will do the job of tying the files together, formatting, and putting them into the suite.

## Creating a New How-To

To create a new how-to, copy the template directory and its contents within this directory. Name the folder according to the short name of the guideline, converted to a path by lowercasing the name and replacing all punctuation, including whitespace, with hyphens. For example, "Text Alternatives" becomes "text-alternatives". Then edit each file in the folder with the appropriate content.

## How-To Content

Each file in the how-to contains particular content.

### index.html

### get-started.html

### plan.html

### design.html

### develop.html

### examples.html

### resources.html

## Other Resources in How-Tos

You may add resources to how-tos, such as images, stylesheets, scripts, and examples. Create sub-directories for each type of resource you add: "img" for images, "style" for stylesheets, "script" for scripts, "examples" for examples. Use relative links to any resource that is part of the how-to.
