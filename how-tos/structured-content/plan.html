				<h2>Planning responsibilities</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Ensure that people can quickly find information within your product's text. </li>
					<li>Headings make it easier for people to find information. Too many headings or disorganized headings make it more difficult. Review headings in your usability testing. </li>
					<li>If your organization wants to qualify for a certain conformance level of Silver, then see the Methods section. </li>

				<h2>Tips for collaboration</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Editors or people responsible for writing text know to keep it well organized. </li>
					<li>Designers include an appropriate organization and design of headings for your product.</li>
					<li>Developers use semantic heading elements -- not just text that is visibly styled as a heading. </li>
					<li>UX team knows to evaluate the organization of the text</li>
					<li>QA testers know to include testing for appropriate heading structure, including semantic code (if available)</li>
				</ul>

					<h3>How to get started early</h3>
					<p>Early project meetings need to discuss accessibility and the importance of improving the usability of the site for people with disabilities. Writing, designing, and coding well organized text content will help all users. </p>

				<section id="remediate">
					<h3>How to remediate</h3>
					<p>The most common problem with headings is visually styled headings that are not semantic, so assistive technology (like screen readers) cannot tell that the text is a heading. The developers need to research the appropriate semantic code. In HTML, that would be an h1, h2, h3 tag. For other technologies, see the Method for that technology. </p>
