				<h2>Design responsibilities</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Ensure that the text of your product is structurally organized. </li>
					<li>The visual styling of the different heading levels also helps to organize the content. </li>
					<li>Visual styling needs to be coded semantically, that is, the code communicates the level of the headings to non-visual users. This is more of a developer responsibility, but it can be a common issue if the design team "owns" the CSS, which could force a developer to use a non-semantic code element to get the appearance the designer wants.</li>
