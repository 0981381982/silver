				<h2>Planning responsibilities</h2>
				Prior to finalizing the project budget, consider possible costs associated with developing accessible content, written in clear language.
During project planning, coordinate efforts with the project team to organize and schedule the approach to creating content written in clear words . Considerations to discuss:
If possible, secure content authors or editors with experience writing in plain language
Direct content authors to the clear words guideline
Provide training on how to develop content that uses plain language principles. Determine if you will create a style guide to clearly communicate the unique needs of your content. Plan and schedule iterative plain language quality assurance checks throughout the project cycle. Schedule time for cycles of editing.
If your content requires legal review, bring in legal experts early so they agree with using plain language.
If your content uses a lot of technical terms, idioms, jargon, metaphors or sarcasm, plan the time to write clear words summaries.
You may need a glossary section to define terms. This will need to be designed and coded.
