<h3>Clear Language</h3>
	<p>Short description of guidance</p>
</div>
<h3>Summary </h3>
<p>Clear language helps create more accessible content.  It helps people understand what is important and what to do with the information they read. This includes guidance on word choice, language structure, instructions and use of numbers and symbols.</p>

<p>Writing and editing in plain language means using:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common words
<li>Concrete and literal words and phrases
<li>Consistent, clear and simple language structure.
<li>Language that clearly illustrates the main point and take-aways.
<li>Clear, short, step-by-step instructions 
<li>Explanations of icons, numbers, and acronyms 
<li>Multiple ways to present complex information (images, sound and text) 
</ul>

<h3>Why</h3>
<ul>
<li>Clear language is more user-friendly.  
<li>Language is more clear when it’s easier to understand.  Readers can follow instructions and remember what’s important.
<li>When information is not clear, many people may feel more tired, confused, anxious or distracted.  
<li>Some may read more slowly, re-read many times to process and remember information, or they may not understand the information at all.
<li>Clear language improves everyone's reading success and allows for a broader audience.
</ul>

<h3>Who it helps</h3>
<p>There are many types of disabilities that can make it harder to read, including a large range of cognitive and learning disabilities, mental health conditions, aging-related conditions, and cognitive impacts of some chronic or other health conditions. </p>
<p>Not all individuals with cognitive and learning disabilities have the same needs. Difficulties with reading vary by disability but also by individual. It’s important not to make assumptions.  Many people with disabilities can understand specialized or complex information, but they may benefit from the same principles of clear language. </p>
<p>Clear language generally helps everyone, especially people who may have difficulty reading due to disability. Reading may also be more difficult when tired, distracted, under stress, with low-literacy, when working outside one’s first language (such as with some sign language users), or when vision is impaired. </p>
<p>Difficulties with reading may be related to challenges with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning, decoding, using or remembering words
<li>Understanding words and phrases that are abstract or ambiguous
<li>Following complex sentence or story structure
<li>Reading and processing speed
<li>Determining main point from detail
<li>Understanding instructions and what to do with them
<li>Remembering what was read
<li>Using new and unfamiliar symbols and/or acronyms
<li>Understanding math and numbers
</ul>


 </p>
<h3>How</h3>
<ul>
<li>Write clearly. 
<li>Refer to lists of common words
<li>Use a professional editor
<li>See the Write tab for more information
</ul>
