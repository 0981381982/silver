<h2>Get Started</h2>
<h3>Section Headings</h3>
	<p>Section Headings: Use headings and sub-headings for your text (formerly WCAG 2.4.10</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
	<p>Section headings -- including titles and subtitles -- organize words and images on a web page. <p>
	<p>Types of content that may use a heading:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Documents
		<li>Web pages
		<li>Paragraphs
		<li>Images
		<li>Graphics
	</ul>

<h3>Why</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Headings help people understand and navigate what you write.
		<li>Headings make it easier to find updated content.
		<li>Mobile users find it easier to scan material with clear headings.
		<li>Headings allow readers to skim longer passages of text and choose which parts they want to learn about in more depth.   
	</ul>		
 <h3>Who it helps</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Visually impaired and blind people use headings to navigate sections.  
		<li>People with cognitive disabilities use headings to understand how writers organize their thoughts. 
		<li>People who use keyboard navigation use headings to jump to content they want to read.
		<li>All readers benefit from clear organization and navigation, especially when their time and energy are limited.
	</ul>
<h3>How</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Organize your text into sections and give each of them a heading.  
		<li>Write a heading that clearly and concisely describes the topic in the section below.
		<li>Use layers of subheadings to organize within sections.
		<li>Include your headings and subheadings in your site map or table of contents.
		<li>Use chapters -- like a printed book -- for longer blocks of text.
	</ul>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>You don't need to insert headings into documents you upload from another author, or in a place where they won't work for artistic reasons. But remember to add them where you can—your readers will appreciate it.
		<li>Don’t just use a heading because it’s catchy; be sure the heading gives structure and context to its related content.
		<li>Form fields, menus and checkboxes are not headings.  For more information about how to do these, please see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#user-interface-componentdef">user interface components</a>. [Editor Note: We haven't worked out how to display definitions yet, so for now, they just all link to WCAG.]

	</ul>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<h4> A restaurant menu heading structure</h4>
	<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
		<li>Layer 1 - Menu
		<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
			<li>Layer 2 - Appetizers
			<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
				<li>Layer 3 - Soups
				</li></ul>
			</li></ul>
		</li>

<h2>Planning</h2>
<h3>Section Headings</h3>
	<p>Use headings and sub-headings for your text. </p>
	<p>See <a href="#section1">Get Started</a> for basic information.</p>
<h3>Planning Responsibilities:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>You must ensure that people can quickly find information within the text of your product. </li>
		<li>Headings must make it easier for people to find information. Too many headings or disorganized headings make it more difficult. Plan on making the use of headings part of your usability testing. </li>
	</ul>
<h3>Tips for Collaboration</h3>
	<ul>
        <li>Editors or people responsible for writing text know to keep it well organized. </li>
		<li>Designers include an appropriate organization and design of headings for your product.</li>
		<li>Developers use semantic heading elements -- not just text that is visibly styled as a heading. </li>
		<li>UX team knows to evaluate the organization of the text</li>
		<li>QA testers know to include testing for appropriate heading structure, including semantic code (if available)</li>
	</ul>
<h3>Planning for Each Stage:</h3>
        <p><strong>How to get started early:</strong> Early project meetings need to discuss accessibility and the importance of improving the usability of the site for people with disabilities. Writing, designing, and coding well organized text content will help all users. </p>
        <p><strong>How to remediate: </strong> The most common problem with headings is visually styled headings that are not semantic, so assistive technology (like screen readers) cannot tell that the text is a heading.  The developers need to research the appropriate semantic code.  In HTML, that would be an h1, h2, h3 tag.  For other technologies, see the Method for that technology. </p>
<h3>Best Practices to Measure Success:</h3>
