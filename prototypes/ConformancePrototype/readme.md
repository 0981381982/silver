# Conformance Prototype
Created by @jspellman

## Basic Prototype Description
A new conformance structure is integral to Silver meeting the needs of people with disabilities, rapidly evolving technology, and the needs of regulators for clear compliance measurement. This editors' draft of a prototype of a conformance structure is based on the Silver research of 2017-2018, the results of the Silver Design Sprint of March 2018, and input from the AccessU Prototyping session of May 2018.  This prototype is divided into three areas: Compliance, Measurement, and Accessibility Supported.
