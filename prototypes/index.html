<h1> Silver Community Group Prototypes</h1>
  <p>The Silver Task Force and Silver Community Group are soliciting and building prototypes of the future Silver design and structure.  
    You are welcome to contribute to ideas and comments to the work. See the instructions below to submit a prototype.  </p>
  <h2>List of Prototypes to date</h2>
    <p>This list is updated sporadicly and could be behind. Use the Code tab in Github to explore the /prototypes/ folder. </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="ConformancePrototype.html">Conformance Prototype 1</a> which has been developed from Silver Design Sprint, Silver member input,
      and AccessU meeting public input.</li>
  </ul>
<h2>Instructions for Prototypes</h2>
<p>Thank you for helping us with developing or refining prototypes for Silver, the successor to WCAG. </p>
<ol>
<li>Please review the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/silver/2018/04/23/suggestions-of-silver-design-sprint/">Suggestions from the Design Sprint</a> for an overall idea of the directions Silver is planning to take. </li>
<li>Review the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/silver/draft-final-report-of-silver/">Design Sprint Report</a> for more detail on what was discussed at the Design Sprint and for more ideas. </li>
<li>Create a new branch with the name of: <br />prototype-[short-name-of prototype]-[your initials] </li>
<li>Write up your ideas using the short-name as the file name. If it is more than one file, consider creating a folder with the same name as your prototype short-name. Use index.html as the file name of the main document if you are using a folder. </li>
<li>Edit this file (prototypes/index.html) to add a link to your prototype to the list. 
<li>Submit a pull request.  
<li>This list needs a lot more development, but it's a rough start. </li>
