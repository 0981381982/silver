## Basic Prototype Description
The purpose of this prototype is to show how it would be possible to include a variety of different 'flavors' to be used within Silver. The prototype uses WCAG 2.0 SC 1.1.1 (Non-Visual Text) and displays this in a method that makes it clearer that different implementations of this SC is possible using different technology

## Development Notes
- Jekyll was used for development but doesn't play nice when it is started within a subdirectory.
 - Links to this prototype should be routed through the **_site** folder which is normally included in the gitignore.
 - When developing, do not edit items in the site folder, edit main items and then create the site using **jekyll serve**


## Content Notes
- Notes from https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Start_with_Accessibility#Project_Initiation_Stage used to structure menu system
