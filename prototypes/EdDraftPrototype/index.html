<p>Silver Accessibility Guidelines does not yet have an official name. It is intended to be the next major version that will replace the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). One of the goals of the Silver Accessibility Guidelines is that it will be written using plain language as much as possible so that people who are not technical can still understand it, and so Silver can more easily be translated into other languages.  When it is finished, Silver Accessibility Guidelines will have a lot of ways for making the web and other digital content (like video or mobile apps) more accessible to people with disabiltities. </p>
<p>Silver Accessibility Guidelines doesn't have any real content yet. This W3C Community Group Editor's draft shows how the accessibility guidelines could be organzied for people who need to see accessibility guidance as a W3C technical report, which is what the W3C calls their official standards. It has silly language (lorem ipsum or pirate ipsum) in it to show where the helpful information will go.  </p>

<p><strong>Most people who would like to use the Silver Accessibility Guidelines should follow this link to <a href="https://mikecrabb.github.io/silver_taggingSystemDemo/index.html">view the Silver accessibility guidance in a more usable format </a></strong>. </p>

<p>Following these guidelines will make content more accessible to more people with disabilities, but will not address every need for every person with a disability or multiple disabilities. </p>

<p>The first paragraph above this is required information from the W3C that most people do not have to pay close attention to. It is useful for people who work directly with standards. </p> 
<p>This document is a First Editor's draft of a W3C Community Group report. This means that this draft is not complete and has a lot of silly language to show where real help with accessibility will go when it is finished.  It is written by the combined Silver Community and Silver Task Force of the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group of the W3C. Every time the editor's draft is published, it becomes more useful and more complete.  This is a first draft, so there is a lot that is not done. </p>

<p>The combined Silver groups plan to publish Silver as a web application that is easy to use and navigate. It is a requirement of the W3C to publish a technical report that meets their rules for what a standards document looks like. The Silver group plans to have the main view of Silver be the web application. This draft is a mockup that shows what the Silver Accesssibility Guidelines version that looks like a W3C Technical Report could look like. </p>

<p>The combined Silver Community Group and Silver Task Force plans to write more Editor's Drafts of Silver. The Silver groups will start writing what will go in the Silver Accessibility Guidelines in 2019. They plan for this work to eventually be transfered to a W3C working group to become an W3C Recommendation which is the offical name for a W3C standard. There will be a way of viewing the accessibility guidelines for people who work directly with standards. </p>
<p> Most people should use the <a href="https://mikecrabb.github.io/silver_taggingSystemDemo/index.html">version of Silver that is designed for usability</a> for designers, developers, project planners, QA testers, and others. </p>
