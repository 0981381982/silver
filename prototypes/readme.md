## Instructions for Prototypes
Thank you for helping us with developing or refining prototypes for Silver, the successor to WCAG. Before creating any prototypes for Silver:

* Please review the [Suggestions from the Design Sprint](https://www.w3.org/community/silver/2018/04/23/suggestions-of-silver-design-sprint/) for an overall idea of the directions Silver is planning to take.
* Review the [Design Sprint Report](https://www.w3.org/community/silver/draft-final-report-of-silver/)

If this is a new prototype, create a new branch with the name of: **prototype-[short-name-of prototype]**. Each prototype should:
* Be contained in its own folder present in the main **protoypes** folder
* Be accessed initially through an **index.html** page
* Have an accompanying **readme.md** file containing any relevant information (please use the template provided)
