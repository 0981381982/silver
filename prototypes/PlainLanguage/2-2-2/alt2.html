<h2>Provide Users with a Clean, Quiet, Still Alternative </h2>
<h3>Why?  </h3>
<p>Everyone wants to keep up with the latest trends in web and app design, which may include moving images, sound, blinking lights and fast updates.  </p>
<p>But all those features can interfere with or destroy the user experience for many people, distracting them from your key content or leaving them behind.  </p>
<p>That's why it's key that users should be able to Pause, Stop, and Hide any moving and interactive features and experience a clean, quiet, still page.</p>
<h3>Who it helps?</h3>
<p>Some people with visible and invisible disabilities can be overwhelmed, confused and even made ill by images that move, blink, make sounds, scroll or update frequently.  </p>
<p>Blinking and movement are particularly distracting for some people with a range of cognitive disabilities.</p>
<p>Some also might need more time to find, read, process or respond to the images and sounds. </p>
<p>And some assistive technology can’t process all your added features at their set speed or at all.</p>

<h3>How?</h3>
<p>Avoid autoplay where unnecessary.
<p>Create a function to Pause, Stop, and Hide elements that: Move, Blink or Scroll, Update or makes Sounds.  </p>
<p>Pausing gives users more time to experience each image and requires unpausing to continue.  </p>
<p>Stop should be available even for short-lived sounds and images.  </p>
<p>Hide allows users to see a page without any of the distractions.</p>
<p>Create a parallel text experience for those who don't want movement or sound, so they can access the information without having to watch, listen or feel.</p>
<p>Provide users with control over frequency of updates, except where auto-updating is essential to the function.  Use jump-to-current function when users unpause, so they can get the latest information when they’re ready.</p>

<h3>Exceptions?</h3>

<p>There is a 5-second exception for flashing content that is necessary. [NOTE: Why??]</p>
<p>Features where auto-updates are essential, such as streaming video, are allowed, where the person chooses to play it.</p>
<p>Animations showing update progress are allowed, as removing them might make users think the function was frozen or broken.</p>
<p>It may not be possible to translate everything in the movement feature into text.  It is important to translate that which is essential to understanding.</p>
<p>The difference between blinking and flashing is the speed of the change.  Blinking is slower; flashes occur faster than 3 times per second and are usually brighter and can trigger seizures. </p>
<p>For rules about Flashes, see also 2.3.  Flashes are not included in this section because pausing and stopping functions are not enough to reduce their risks.</p>
<p>It is ok to require all users to view a 15-second advertisement before accessing other free video content.</p>

<h3>Technical Tips?</h3>
<p>How to use scripts to add pause, stop, hide features.</p>
<p>How to add buttons for clean, quiet, still experience option.</p>
<p>SL 11, 12, 24.</p>

<h3>Examples?</h3>
<p>Carousels are not accessible for some people.  It is better to have a slide show that someone clicks through at their own pace.</p>
<p>Videos, synchronized media presentations, animations, real-time games, advertisements, scrolling stock tickers, as well as auto-updated weather information, news and stock prices all need pause, stop, and hide features.</p>
<p>For "status" information like stock tickers, stock prices, weather information and news, unpausing should then jump-to-present to provide latest information.</p>
<p>Use pause functions in games so users can take more time for their turn and continue to participate in the competition.</p>
