        <h1>Silver Prototype Example - Plain Language</h1>
        <p>The purpose of this prototype is to show how existing WCAG 2.0 guidance could be converted into plain language. For this experiment, a group of editors and plain language experts were asked to take four existing WCAG success criteria and convert them to plain language. Some chose to stick closely to the existing WCAG structure.  Others chose to be creative in imagining how users would want to see the information organized.  </p>
        <p>The four WCAG 2.0 success criteria for this experiement were selected as easy, hard, moderate, and long success criteria to understand.  The success criteria are: </p>
        <ul>
        	<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#navigation-mechanisms-headings">2.4.10 Section headings</a> is pretty simple. </li>
			<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#ensure-compat-rsv">4.1.2 Name, Role, Value</a> is one of the most complex  </li>
			<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#content-structure-separation-understanding">1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics</a>  is moderately difficult </li>
			<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#time-limits-pause">2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide</a> is also a midrange, but is very long  </li>
         </ul>
		
		<p>We are interested in your feedback about the use of plain language and the organization of the guidance.  Please use the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfHZjFDyKzwa16UiPBAvCu-8OFiaqa4fUP_2ZcTjzV7Wn0gKg/viewform">survey in Google forms</a> to guide your feedback.
