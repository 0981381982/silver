<p><strong>2.4.10 Section Headings:</strong> Use Lots of Headings and Sub-Headings for your text</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Headings are a road map to help people understand and navigate what you write.</li>
<li>All readers benefit from clear organization and navigation, especially when they have limited time and energy.  </li>
<li>Mobile users find it easier to scan material with clear headings.  </li>
<li>Headings also make it easier to find updated content.  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Who it helps?</h3>
<ul>


<li>Visually impaired and blind people use headings to navigate sections.  </li>
<li>People with cognitive disabilities use headings to understand how you organize your thoughts. </li>
<li>People who use keyboard navigation use headings to jump to content they are interested in. </li>
</ul>
<h3>How?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Organize your text into sections and give each of them a heading.  </li>
<li>Use headings that clearly communicate the topic of the text below, so readers can skim to understand what youâ€™re writing about, and can choose which parts they want to learn about it in more depth.  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Exceptions? </h3>
<ul>

<li>You don't need to insert headings into documents you upload from another author, or in a place where they won't work for artistic reasons.  </li>
<li>But remember to add them where you can -- your readers will appreciate it. </li>

</ul>
<h3>Technical Tips:</h3>
<ol>
<li>In HTML: Use H1, H2, H3 where H1 is for page titles, H2 is for headings, H3 for subheadings.  This helps those with screen readers navigate, and helps create a site map of headings that describe their relative importance.</li>
<li>Keep headings and subheadings consistent in terms of font colour and size, so readers can easily recognize them. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>H1 - MENU</p>
<p>H2 - Appetizers, Entree, Dessert</p>
<p>H3 - Under Appetizers: Salads, Soups</p>
