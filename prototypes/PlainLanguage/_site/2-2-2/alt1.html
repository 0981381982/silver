		<h2>2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide</h2>
<p>If web content moves, blinks, scrolls, or updates automatically, all of the following are true: (Level A) </p>
<ol>
<li>Moving, blinking, scrolling: If moving, blinking or scrolling information starts automatically, lasts more than five seconds, or is presented at the same time as other content, there’s a way for the user to pause, stop, or hide the information – unless it’s an activity where the movement, blinking or scrolling is essential.</li>
<li>Auto-updating: If information updates automatically, starts automatically and is presented at the same time as other content, there is a way for the user to pause, stop, hide, or control the frequency of the update – unless it’s an activity where the auto-update is essential.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note 1: For requirements related to flickering or flashing content, refer to Guideline 2.3.</p>
<p>Note 2: Because content that fails this success criterion can interfere with a person’s ability to use anything else on the same webpage, all content must meet this success criterion, even content used to meet other success criteria. See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference.</p>
<p>Note 3: Content that’s updated periodically by software or streamed to the user agent isn’t required to preserve or present information that’s generated or received when the content is paused. This may not be feasible, and could mislead users. </p>
<p>Note 4: An animation that happens only when users can’t interact with web content, such as to indicate progress during a preload, can be considered essential if the lack of movement could confuse users or cause them to think that content is frozen or broken.</p>
