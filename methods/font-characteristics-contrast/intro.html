				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<p>The visual contrast needed for easy reading of text is substantially higher than the contrast needed just to "make out" words. At least ten times more contrast is needed for good <em>readability</em> than the bare minimum contrast needed for <em>legibility</em>.</p>
				
				<p>Perception of contrast is affected not only by the lightness and darkness of the colors used for the text and background, but also by the weight (thickness) of the font, the font's size, and the relative spacing of lines and letters.</p>
				
				<p>A person's contrast sensitivity shifts throughout their lifetime, and visual impairments can cause a substantial reduction in contrast perception, requiring higher contrast text for the same readability. 
				
				<p>Use objective guidelines and tools to evaluate font stroke width (weight), font size, background color, font color, and nearby colors and adjust the properties of those elements to achieve good visual contrast and readability.</p>

				<h2>How it solves user need</h2>
				<p>All sighted users need adequate text size and weight, coupled with ample luminance contrast (lightness/darkness difference) between background and text colors, in order to read the text easily. </p>
