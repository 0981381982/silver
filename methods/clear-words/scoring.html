				<h2>Rating</h2>
				<p>The tester should look for: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Uses technical or jargon words that are not linked to a definition. Use a common word list for your language.  The list should be at least 3000 words long.  </li>
					<li>If definitions are available, a person can get to a definition in one click and return in one click. Give less points if a person who wants a definition has to search a glossary and then navigate back to where they were reading.  </li>
				</ul>
