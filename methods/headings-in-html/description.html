				<h2>Outcome and Functional Categories</h2>
				<p>This method supports the outcome <q>Provides semantic structure that conveys a sense of hierarchy that helps the user explore and navigate the text material to support assistive technology -- headings are coded as headings</q>.</p>
				<p>This outcome relates to the following functional categories:</p>
			</section>
			<ul>
				<li>Sensory - Vision and Visual</li>
				<li>Physical - Motor</li>
				<li>Cognitive - Executive</li>
			</ul>
			<section id="technical">
				<h2>Technical description</h2>
			</section>
			<p>Nest headings by their rank (or level). The most important heading has the rank 1 (<code>&lt;h1></code>), the least important heading rank 6 (<code>&lt;h6></code>). Headings with an equal or higher rank start a new section, headings with a lower rank start new subsections that are part of the higher ranked section.</p>
			<p>Skipping heading ranks can be confusing and should be avoided where possible: Make sure that a <code>&lt;h2></code> is <strong>not</strong> followed directly by an <code>&lt;h4></code>, for example. It is ok to skip ranks when closing subsections, for instance, a <code>&lt;h2></code> beginning a new section, can follow an <code>&lt;h4></code> as it closes the previous section.</p>
			<section>
				<h3>Exception for fixed page sections</h3>
				<p>In fixed sections of the page, for example in sidebars, the heading ranks <em>should not</em> change depending on the ranks in the content area. In those cases, consistency across pages is more important.</p>
