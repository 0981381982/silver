				<h2>Critical Failures</h2>
				<p>If headings necessary to locating the content that is necessary to accomplish the task or follow the path are not coded as headings, that is a critical failure. <p>

				<h2>Rating</h2>
				<h3>What is important and why</h3>
				<ul>
				<li>Headings that only have visual styling without underlying semantic code cannot be properly interpreted by assistive technologies like screen readers.  If headings have a <code>&lt;div></code> or other tag than an <code>&lt;h1></code>-<code>&lt;h6></code>, then aria attributes are used to create a heading with the correct level.</li>
				<li>If a hierarchy of headings is used, then the semantic structure must communicate that hierarchy.  </li>
				<li>Without semantic structure the page, screen, or view is just a large blob of text with no organization.  People who listen to a page sequentially need the organization to give them the ability to “browse” the material.  </li>
				</ul>
				<table>
				<tr>
					<td>Rating 0</td>
					<td>Headings have the incorrect semantics (any non-heading element without the necessary heading-related ARIA attributes, like role="heading" aria-level="3"). </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Rating 1</td>
					<td>50% or less of the visual headings are semantically coded</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Rating 2</td>
					<td>51-80% of the visual headings are semantically coded</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Rating 3</td>
					<td>81-95% of the visual headings are semantically coded</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Rating 4</td>
					<td>Whatever technique is used, the 96% - 100% of the sections have properly coded headings and the levels communicate the hierarchy</td>
				</tr>
