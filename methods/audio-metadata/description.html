				<h2>Detailed description</h2>
				<p>The objective of this method is to provide a way for people to situate sounds within an XR environment without the requirement to hear the sound itself. This method will apply to those that do not have access to stereo (or better) sound and are therefore unable to locate sounds within a 3D environment. With this method, metadata for all captioned elements are stored alongside caption text and can be presented to the user in an alternative format when needed. This requires special support for captioning in the user agent.</p>

				<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/immersive-captions/">W3C immersive captioning subgroup</a> are key stakeholders in the development of this work</p>
