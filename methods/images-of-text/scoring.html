				<h2>Critical Failures</h2>
				<p>Any image without alternative text that stops people from completing the task on the path</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If an image of text is not purely decorative and CSS is used instead of an img element, that is a failure. </li>
					<li>If an image of text is not purely decorative and the img element doesnâ€™t have an alt attribute, that is a failure. </li>
					<li>If an image of text is not purely decorative and the value of the alt attribute of the img element is not the equivalent  of the text in the image of text, that is a failure. </li>

			<section id="rating">
				<h2>Rating</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>The average of the adjectival rating of all the HTML Alternative Text Methods  OR </li>
					<li>The number of images in the document that pass divided by the total  number of images in the document. GIve the answer as a percentage.  (This allows for automated testing of images.  </li>
				</ul>
				<p>That an image that is necessary to completing a task or getting help with a task has alternative text. If too many images that may not be essential to the task do not have alternative text, then the fatigue of trying to figure out what is in content without alternative text is also a barrier to people.  </p>
