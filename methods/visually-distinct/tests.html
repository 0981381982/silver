					<h3>For non-plain-text views</h3>
					<p>The easiest way to determine if a heading is visually distinct is to carry out a squint test. You can do this by squinting your eyes at a page until the content becomes blurry. You should be able to perceive headings, and their related content, as distinct blocks of content.</p>
					<p>If you don’t want to or can’t squint at a screen, you can use a browser extension such as <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nocoffee/jjeeggmbnhckmgdhmgdckeigabjfbddl?hl=en-US">No Coffee</a> that simulates different forms of low vision. Again, you’re checking to see that headings can be perceived as distinct blocks of content.</p>
					<p>If you don’t want to use a browser extension, you can use CSS filters on the HTML element to alter the view’s presentation. For example, the blur filter will blur the view’s content: </p>
<pre>
&lt;html lang=”en” style=”filter:blur:5px”>
</pre>
You can also chain filters, for example by adding a grayscale to remove all the color:
<pre>
&lt;html lang=”en” style=”filter:blur:5px grayscale(100)”>
</pre>

					<h3>Testing for plain text</h3>
					<p>For plain text documents that don’t use markdown, read the document and look for content that acts as headings. Check that there are two blank lines above the heading and one blank line after the heading.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Testing for Markdown</h3>
					<p>Markdown supports two different styles for headings, but only one style supports more than two levels of headings. For visual consistency, check that one style is used consistently in the document, for example: each heading starts with one or more # characters. </p>
					<p>Markdown can also be tested using applications that support in-application markdown previews. Markdown, and a preview of the converted file, can be tested as the file is being written.
