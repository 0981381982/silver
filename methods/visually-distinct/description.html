				<h2>Technical description</h2>
				<p>Although there is nothing stopping a designer or developer picking font sizes on whim, using a typographic scale to create a series of type sizes, line heights, and margins creates a feeling of connectedness in the components in a view. This, combined with well-chosen margins and font weight will make headings more visually distinct than their surrounding body text. </p>
				<p>Creating whitespace that is visually closer to its related block of content than the preceding content provides a further visual clue to the relationship between the heading and its content. There should be more whitespace before the heading and less after it. </p>
				<p>For plain text where markdown isnâ€™t used, a heading is created by leaving two lines of whitespace before, and one line of whitespace after, a line of text. </p>
