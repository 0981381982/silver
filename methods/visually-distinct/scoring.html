				<h2>Critical Failures</h2>
				<p>If there are multiple headings in a path that are not visually distinct, this can cause excessive fatigue, frustration, and confusion for some people.  For example, a news outlet can cause fatigue by presenting people with too many different heading styles so they have to read every heading instead of being able to quickly identify sections.  </p>

			<section id="rating">
				<h2>Rating</h2>
				<p><strong>What is important and why</strong></p>
				<p>The ability to use valid headings to navigate to relevant content that the user is interested in reduces the amount of time assistive technology users need to spend processing information that they know that they are not interested in. </p>
				<table class="rating-table">
					<caption>Rating Scale</caption>
				<tr>
					<td>Rating 0</td>
					<td>A critical failure on the path OR only 25% or less of the headings that should exist meet the requirements in Rating 4.  </td>

						<ol>
							<li>Non-plain text headings are larger than body text, are designed to correspond to their heading level, have more contrast than the viewâ€™s body copy, and are visibly connected to their related content using whitespace. OR</li>
							<li>Plain text headings have two blank lines of space before them and one blank line of space after them. OR</li>
							<li>Markdown headings have one line of space before them, and a suitable, heading level styled consistently with the other headings in the view.</li>
