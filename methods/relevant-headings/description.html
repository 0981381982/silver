				<h2>Detailed description</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>All headings should contain an appropriate amount of information to allow the user to understand the content being presented between that heading and the next heading.  </li>
					<li>Headings are not restricted to text content, they can be used to identify sections containing only images, links, or multimedia.    </li>
					<li>Headings level hierarchy should be consistent within their section. 
					<ul>
						<li>Don’t skip levels when going deeper into the hierarchy (i.e. don’t go from H2 to H4).</li>
						<li>You may skip levels when going higher into the hierarchy if it is internally consistent with your header structure (i.e. you may go from H4 to H2).
					</li></ul></li>
